0,t3_yt6p9y,askgaybros,I am having huge internal conflict in even following FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar,"I am massively into International Football (Soccer) but I can't get myself to even follow what the next month or so brings. I am torn between the sport I love and the location that was selected to host it. There is a lot of discussion around it on social media but the following video kinda encapsulates (at least to me) what the hosts are thinking of around LGBT issues. Is anyone having this 'internal conflict'?

8,t3_yy6v1m,askgaybros,My boss wants me to go to Dubai,"My boss has asked me to go to Dubai for business for about a week (it's actually a conference with people from all over the world, not much local interaction).

Long ago I decided to never go to a country where being gay was illegal, let alone punishable by death. I also refuse to fly on any airline (e.g. Emirates, Qatar, ethiad) owned by such an evil regime. I won't even transit through the airports of such places.

I've not discussed this issue with my boss yet. The only other person who could go in my place is a straight female colleague. I've discussed it with her, and she rightly responded that she thinks the same and wouldn't go to a homophobic country, and also pointed out that the treatment of women there is also terrible, and so doesn't want to go. So there's no way I'd dump this on her.

Would you point blank refuse to go? Go and hide the gay away for a week? I could pull off the latter but don't want to, I love being gay.

Any gay bros out there who have been to Dubai or other homophobic countries? How did you manage it?

UPDATE - wow, what a response. Lots of helpful suggestions here.

I decided I'm not going. While I know I would probably be able to go and avoid being imprisoned or killed for being gay, it just doesn't sit right with me. Just the thought of it being illegal to be me it's too much. I don't want to be there.

I spoke with my boss and colleagues about this and everybody gets it. Being able to have this discussion is just another reminder of the political rights I have here in Australia which are denied to those in Dubai.

My boss was kind enough to say that I might be able to go on a different work trip the year after instead (he said Geneva!!!! - that sounds awesome) as he doesn't want me being gay to mean I miss out on the international experience. So that was really kind.

Thanks again everybody, I appreciate it.",206,0.97,1054,0,1054,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/yy6v1m/my_boss_wants_me_to_go_to_dubai/

13,t3_z3q71r,askgaybros,"I read only like 10% or less of population is LGBTQ. I call bullshit. There’s literally no way it’s that low. I say it’s more like, AT LEAST, 50-60%. Here’s why…","I’m a good looking, fit, masculine, gay man. I work in retail and I can confidently say that at least 50-60% of the “straight” guys I work with are attracted to me. Many even have girlfriends. Some know I’m gay. Same thing at the gym. I always find these “straight” married men checking me out and getting all nervous around me. My gaydar is always on point. 

To me, it’s very annoying that society downplays the size of our community and also feel like it makes life that more difficult for us. I know many people say that they don’t care about labels or are afraid to come out, but if more people came forward, we could increase the visibility of our community and hopefully pave the way for a more equal and fair world for us, not just here in America, but in the entire world itself. I do also feel that even many of our own in our community also download the size of our community and reject the idea that the LGBTQ community is larger than society makes it to be.

Besides, many of these studies that calculate the percentage of LGBTQ people in the world are based off of asking people if they identify as such. We all know that there are a large number of people who are closeted and wouldn’t even admit to being LGBT even if it was an anonymous survey. Many people don’t even admit it to themselves. I myself was in denial until I was 24 years old. I am now 32. I just feel like there should be a better way of determining the percentage and size of our community to increase more visibility and demand equal rights once and for all. This would also make it easier for others to feel more accepted and have the courage to accept themselves as they are and finally live as their true authentic selves.

PS. Fuck Qatar and all these other countries that still view homosexuality as illegal. I feel so powerless and infuriated that we can’t do much for our community in those countries. Proving that our community is MUCH larger than society makes it to be would pave the way for people in those countries to finally be free as they deserve to be.",64,0.28,0,0,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/z3q71r/i_read_only_like_10_or_less_of_population_is/

15,t3_sk86oc,askgaybros,How do you feel about the Soccer World Cup in Qatar 2022 as a gay person?,"Do you soccer fans out there have mixed feelings about the World Cup being held in a homophobic country? 

Just for context on my thinking:
================================
I’m not particularly a huge soccer fan, I only watch matches like the Eurocup or the Champions with my straight friends at bars (mostly there for booze and the good time); I’m usually quite excited about the World Cups and Olympic Games and the vibe around these events like short documentaries about the host countries, mascots, etc etc. 

I can’t feel the same about Qatar 2022 though. The fact that they still have a death penalty for gay people and some of the direst conditions for LGBT folk really draws my attention away (not to mention their deplorable treatment of migrants and their astonishing lack of women’s rights).

I feel like FIFA is being super hypocritical; on one side they “embrace diversity” and punish those teams or countries with homophobic slurs in their cheering chants, but on the other they hold their World Cup in countries where their laws, THEIR LAWS, state to LITTERALY KILL people for being gay.

I know I shouldn’t mix politics with the game itself, but I simply cannot; up to the point where I’m not interested in following this World Cup at all (maybe boycott, even if this can’t do much).",27,0.86,9,0,9,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/sk86oc/how_do_you_feel_about_the_soccer_world_cup_in/

26,t3_96wz4q,askgaybros,Work trip to Qatar,"Hi,

UK guy here. My client has suggested that they may wish for me to do some work for them in Qatar for upto 2 weeks, helping to train and set up a team.

I'm not averse to the idea on the face of it however, being homosexual and working in a Muslim country which outlaws me does make me nervous. I'm not necessarily effeminate but I am slim and not very tall and, despite being in my mid 30s have always been quite young looking. This often attracts attention when I'm around very male dominated environments and it becomes one of a few things to easily separate me from a group. I guess I'm a bit nervous about being noticed.

The amount of shit people talk behind there back is on a level i’ve never seen in my 22 years so far. The usual, ”i bet they fuck eachother in the toilets at work.” 

They even got beat up pretty badly last year by a guy. He got fired immediately and they did press charges. I’m actually surprised that they’re still working here. You’d think that with the amount of abuse they get, that one day they’ll snap and come to work to shoot up the place. 

I’ve never actually spoken to them since we work in different areas, but i’ve seen one of them on Grindr. He seems to be a normal, nice guy, but at work no one gives a shit about that, he’s just a faggot. He’s a faggot before anything else. 

I’m not openly bi, but from the hate openly gay men get on a regular basis, it has opened my eyes to how nasty and cruel people can be. Honestly you guys deserve so much respect.

30,t3_bad2ol,askgaybros,Here are the 11 countries where being gay is punishable by death according to Gay Times So 11 countries I'm not going on holiday to.,"There are currently 11 countries where being gay can get you killed under law.

While LGBTQ rights have made great strides in parts of the world, homosexuality remains illegal in an estimated 70 countries, and 11 countries carry the potential for the death penalty, particularly among men who have sex with men.

It’s difficult to identify which countries actually enforce the death penalty punishment, or how often they do so, but using data from ILGA, we’ve listed the countries where the death penalty is a possibility for LGB people below.

Afghanistan


What the law says: “Those who commit sodomy, shall be sentenced to medium imprisonment not exceeding two years.” (Penal Code, 2017; Section 647) “A person, defending his honour, who sees his spouse or another of his close relations in the act of committing adultery or being in the same bed with another and immediately kills or injures one or both of them shall be exempted from punishment for laceration and murder but shall be imprisoned for a period not exceeding two years.” (Penal Code, 2017; Article 398)

While the act of same-sex intercourse may not result in the death penalty under Afghanistan’s penal code, honour killings of LGBTQ people by family members aren’t treated as murder and those who commit them will not face more than two years in prison. It is also possible that those engaging in same-sex intercourse in Afghanistan may face the death penalty for violating Sharia law, which is more likely to be happen in smaller, rural locations.

Brunei


What the law says: “Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman, or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.” (Penal Code, 2001; Chapter 22, Section 377)

The newest addition to this list, homosexuality was already punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment in Brunei, but the south-east Asian nation has recently implemented a strict new law that punishes male same-sex activity with death by stoning. Sex acts between women carry a penalty of 40 strokes of the cane along with a possible maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

Iran


What the law says: “The hadd punishment for livat [sodomy] shall be the death penalty for the insertive party if he has committed livat by using force, coercion, or in cases where he meets the conditions for ihsan [married to a woman]; otherwise, he shall be sentenced to one hundred lashes. The hadd punishment for the receptive party, in any case (whether or not he meets the conditions for ihsan) shall be the death penalty.” (Islamic Penal Code, 2013; Article 234)

The maximum penalty for men who have sex with men in Iran is the death penalty. Women who have sex with women face one hundred lashes.

Mauritania


What the law says: “Any adult Muslim man who commits an indecent act or an act against nature with an individual of his sex will face the penalty of death by public stoning.” (Penal Code, 1984; Article 308)

Mauritania’s Penal Code criminalises same-sex activity for both men and women, but with different punishments. Muslim men may receive a sentence of “death by public stoning” while women may receive between three months and two years imprisonment, as well as a fine of 5,000 to 60,000 UM.

Nigeria


What the law says: “Any person who has carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature; or permits a male person to have carnal knowledge of him or her against the order of nature is guilty of a felony, and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.” (Criminal Code Act, 1990; Chapter 77)

While Nigerian law calls for imprisonment, several states have adopted Islamic Sharia laws, which criminalise sexual activity between people of the same sex. The maximum penalty for men is the death penalty, with the maximum penalty for women being whipping or imprisonment.

Qatar


What the law says: “Whoever copulates with a male over sixteen years of age without compulsion, duress or ruse shall be punished with imprisonment for a term up to seven years. The same penalty shall apply to the male for his consent.” (Penal Code, Law No. 11 of 2004; Article 285) “Whoever commits the following offences shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of no less than one year and no more than three years: Leading, instigating or seducing a male by in any way to commit sodomy or dissipation; Inducing or seducing a male or a female in any way to commit illegal or immoral actions.” (Penal Code, Law No. 11 of 2004; Article 296)

As well as the penal code, which makes sodomy punishable with imprisonment, Qatar also runs Sharia courts, where the punishment for Muslim men engaging in same-sex activity could be the death penalty. It’s worth pointing out, however, that there has been no recorded occurrence of this happening.

Saudi Arabia


What the law says: N/A

There is no codified Penal Law in Saudi Arabia, however the country applies strict Islamic Sharia law, which outlaws sexual intercourse between men. All sexual relations outside of marriage, including same-sex relationships, are illegal, and the penalty for a married man is generally thought to be death by stoning.

Somalia


What the law says: “Whoever has carnal intercourse with a person of the same sex shall be punished, where the act does not constitute a more serious crime, with imprisonment from three months to three years.” (Penal Code, Article 409)

While Somaliland, an independent state in the north, applies the Penal Code, a strict interpretation of Sharia law is enforced by Al-Shabaab further south and central in the country. In these areas, the punishment for those found guilty of homosexuality is at a judge’s discretion, and may be death. In March 2013, it was reported that a gay teenager was stoned to death in front of a crowd after he was convicted of sodomy.

Sudan


What the law says: “Whoever commits Sodomy shall be punished with flogging one hundred lashes and he shall also be liable to five years imprisonment. If the offender is convicted for the second time he shall be punished with flogging one hundred lashes and imprisonment for a term which may not exceed five years. If the offender is convicted for the third time he shall be punished with death or life imprisonment.” (Penal Code, Act No. 8, 1991; Section 148)

Men who have sex with men in Sudan can be punished with one hundred lashes and up to five years imprisonment for a first offence; one hundred lashes and up to five years imprisonment for a second offence; and life imprisonment or death for a third offence.

United Arab Emirates


What the law says: “Without prejudice to two preceding articles, the crime of voluntary debasement shall be penalized by detention for a minimum term of one year.” (Penal Code, 1987; Article 356)

All sexual acts outside of heterosexual marriage are banned in the United Arab Emirates. Dubai punishes sodomy with a penalty of up to 14 years imprisonment, while Abu Dhabi punishes sodomy with a penalty of up to 10 years imprisonment. It’s through the offence of Zina in the Sharia code that same-sex sexual relationships could be punished by the death penalty, although there has been no recorded occurrence of this happening.

Yemen


What the law says: “Homosexuality is the contact of one man to another through his posterior; both sodomites whether males or females are punished with whipping of one hundred strokes if not married. It is admissible to reprimand it by imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year, punishment by stoning to death if married.” (Penal Code, 1994; Article 264)

Sexual activity between men in Yemen is punishable by 100 lashes and up to a year imprisonment, while sexual activity between women is punishable with up to three years imprisonment. Married men convicted of homosexuality face the death penalty.

31,t3_i21ide,askgaybros,Why do we support the Muslim community when they despise us?,"Before people report this can you please read this because even though you may be a Muslim who is apart of the LGBT community many Muslims don’t support us and to be honest it scares me. 

It is common practice in majority Muslim population countries to not just arrest gay people and trans people but also to publicly execute and torture them.

First of all Muslims when questioned if homosexuality was morally wrong they strongly agreed, for example in Palestine 89% said homosexuality was morally wrong in Egypt 94%, in Lebanon 97%, in Djibouti 80%, in Chad 92%, in Nigeria 94%. This clearly shows that the majority of Muslims do not like LGBT people. 

Secondly in 12 countries it is punishable by death for being LGBT which are UAE, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Brunei, Qatar, Sudan, Somalia, Afghanistan, Mauritania, Iran, Yemen and terrorist groups like the Taliban and of course the barbaric group known as ISIS. If that’s not bad enough the death sentence isn’t quick you can be sent to death via firing squad but also stoning (which kills the victim via concussion, blood loss or from their wounds) and hanging without a drop (this is where the person is slowly risen while having a nose around their neck, unlike with a drop where their neck breaks giving them a quick death, they slowly suffocate taking between 1-4 hours with the pain so bad they bite their tongue off and can grind their teeth to nothing). 

This reason for this is because of their religion specifically from the Hadith which says “If a man   who is not married is seized committing sodomy, he will be stoned to death. This clearly states that gay people should be stoned to death. 

Also in the Hadith it mentions that men who are raped by another man have committed the same sin as the rapist which means in some Muslim majority nations if a man is raped and he says that he has had sex with another man (even though it wasn’t consensual) he will be put to death. 

You may say that there is no evidence of people showing hate towards LGBT members from the Muslim community so here it is. #suggest_ways_to_kill_faggot has trended on Arab twitter before and for a more personal bit of evidence here are some tweets. After the Orlando nightclub shooting some Muslims tweeted “#OrlandoShooting To hell! May Allah make more and more of this happen” and “#OrlandoShooting the faggots who died and their families need not to be defended, be happy about it and eat shit”. 


From all of what I typed out to show light on a topic which is rarely cared about I would like to say I got all of this from a YouTube video called The Islamic hatred towards Gays and Lesbians by a you-tuber called Kraut.

33,t3_bymyyq,askgaybros,Would you travel to a homophobic country?,"I recently had a discussion with a straight friend that has left me somewhat questioning my views. He wanted me to come and visit him in Qatar and I politely told him that I wouldn't step foot in such a backward shithole that could imprison me for liking dudes. 

He asked me why I couldn't just refrain from fucking whilst visiting homophobic countries and told me that you shouldn't believe everything you hear about other countries. He said that it was exceedingly rare for a tourist to be prosecuted by those laws.

That conversation really got me thinking. In the UK, for example, we still have archaic laws (like in some circumstances it is still legal to shoot a Welsh man with a bow) that we would never enforce. Also if we go back a few decades we weren't the most welcoming place for LGBT individuals either. Isn't the whole point of travelling to connect with individuals on the other side of the globe and see different perspectives? 

Yet on the other hand, as a gay man and a global citizen, I feel that I have a duty to spend my money in places that have some respect for LGBT people. Tourism can have a huge effect on economies and LGBT people on average travel more frequently and spend more than their hetero counterparts (Source below). From the report that I read (again below) nearly 2/3s of lgbt individuals agree with me. I feel that we as a community have a voice and we have a duty to use it. 

I just wanted to hear additional gay perspectives :)

I can't fucking stand any of this shit anymore. 

You know what, I basically spend all my time on the internet. On r/askgaybros, YouTube etc. I basically live in the fucking internet (cos I have no life, duh. I live  in the dorms, though I'd rather spend all my time in my room, like I did for the Tech Fest bullshit we had these two days) Im far, far away from reality that sometimes I don't feel depressed or sad because I feel like I'm living in some Western liberal country. But then stupid reality strikes to burst my bubble of illusion. I feel sad, depressed, dead on the inside. My professors are all gonna screw me upside down now, because my attendence is low (and our college has this mandatory 85 percent attendence, this country is so fucking stupid in terms of everything) and it's barely been a month this semester started.

I apologise in advance for what I'm gonna say next, but all you Americans and Canadians and Western Europeans, while things are still a bit hard there for the LGBT community, y'all have no fucking idea how fucking *PRIVILEGED* you guys are. Am I even allowed to use that fucking word - PRIVILEGED without fucking  offending anyone? Free to live your life and date and marry a guy and have kids someday. Hell, even the basic dignity of life is NOT AN OPTION FOR ME in this shit hole. 

Sometimes I feel I'm privileged, because someday I'll be able to get out of this no good place and move elsewhere for my graduate students like my brothers did. But, I simply don't have the energy and the patience for that day to even come. I'm still in freshman year of college, studying something I don't want to (unlike most other countries, you can't change your major here, ik fucking stupid).

So when I say religious, you better get me. If anything I'm not religious, so that's another headache to worry about) will probably disown me. My brothers are probably open minded, but I don't want to test the waters because it's too much of a risk.

Ugh, I just hate this country, my family and everything. Thankfully, I'm fine with being gay. I'm definitely not fine with all the homophobia and all the bullshit this country has to offer. And before you guys say get therapy, lmao okay. No pysc, therapist or anyone is not homophobic here. I can't even fucking talk to anyone, because if I'm outed, things will be at least a 100 times worse. Life is already hell for me rn.


I'm sorry if I don't make sense or if I made any grammatical errors, I'm just so emotional and out of my head right now. I wish I could live in the internet forever and never come back to this pathetic life of mine. 

I don't think I'll even make these 4 years. Probably, *my name* (1999-2018) will be written on my stupid tombstone. Because that's what this country wants to do to the millions of LGBT people in this country, murder them.

35,t3_5nw6r8,askgaybros,Confessions of a (Formerly) Big Bro,"I havent' spent too much time on this on /gaybros reddit, but I've seen so many similarities in questions that I decided to write this thread to give my experience and maybe shed some light on those younger guys full of anxiety. I feel you. I still have it. I'm a recent 28, so hope this helps. Names and places have been slightly altered. 

When my family moved to America, I was constantly teased. I ate food to comfort myself. As I grew up, I was teased for being gay and I comforted myself with food. However, I also became dangerously suicidal. I never subscribed to religion, and my parents were both PhD atheists. I never had internal struggle accepting my homosexuality, as I knew at an early age. That being said, kids at school were ruthless. I was a suicidal obese (320 lbs, 6 ft) kid, so I did whatever I could to escape. Luckily I was able to go to a fancy prep school and my life changed. 

I hung out with the other gay kids. I was still big, and I wasn't white. I hated how I looked, and I never looked into a mirror. If I did, I would spend hours depressed in my room with my lights shut off. Overall, however, I felt happy that I could be myself. I won scholarships to study abroad in many places. I felt the pain, though, of seeing other gay kids couple off. Meanwhile, I knew I would never even kiss a guy. 

After graduating prep school, I attended uni in NYC. I started to walk more and watch what I ate. I found out that a boy, Chris, from high school had a crush on me sicne then. He was my first. I was 20. He ended up deciding he didn't want a relationship and I was devastated. I drank my sorrows and hooked up with whoever would have me. Chris did teach me that I was beautiful. I started to accept how I looked, my olive skin and black hair and eyes. For the first time in my life someone openly expressed their admiration for my physical appearance. That's why I fell so hard when he decided to not be with me. 

I studied abroad again in Japan. I met Gerald, who was my dream guy. Gerald liked my personality, but he rejected me. We became friends and saw each other after we both returned. I never got over him. I graduated from uni and worked for like four months in NYC. I started getting into drugs and would party all night. I also started losing weight, but I was still a big guy. At this point I was at 280 lbs. 

I got my first real job in Qatar, so I decided to leave NYC and go try out my fortunes in the middle east. I met a guy there named John who was an American expat living with his expat family in Qatar. We had everything in common and we even hooked up sometimes, but he said he wasn't physically attracted to me. I was so hurt, but it wasn't a new feeling. 

My company in Qatar provided me with a personal trainer, so I started to really understand fitness and how to control my body. I dropped down to 240 and continued to work hard. I hated living in Qatar because of how oppressed I felt - especially after NYC. I decided to try my luck out in Singapore. 

In Singapore I became dedicated to the gym. I dropped down to 220 but it wasn't really necessary. Even though I had been at 240, I was pretty muscular. I had a LOT of sex. I was more confident in myself. I realised that my whole racial issues and hangups meant nothing, because I actually was a pretty handsome guy. I also was very talented and smart, so I didn't need to find approval from other guys - especially white guys. 

John (Qatar guy) and I met up a few times and hooked up, but it was still the same deal. He was into twinks, and he couldnt' ever see past that to appreciate my beauty. It hurt, and I started to go down a spiral again. I became so depressed I stopped hanging out with my friends in Singapore. I isolated myself and convinced myself that I would forever be alone. I looked at my body as a curse. Then again, I thought, if I hadn't been so ugly I would have never focused on school and travelled the world at a young age. 

I kept doing mindfulness and calmed my anxieties. I went to grad school in the UK where funnily enough Gerald (Japan guy) was posted for a year. Though we were good friends, we had had spotty contact. Well, he saw me in the UK and things totally changed. We did a lot of posh events in London and travelled to Paris for a romantic weekend. When we both finished our duties in the UK, we ended things amicably. 

Now, I'm at 200 and pretty muscular 6ft. More of a rugby type of guy. I live in Shanghai, making a decent amount of money and taking care of myself. I still feel anxiety about whether a guy likes or dislikes my body. I don't really feel anxiety about my race anymore, because that shit doesn't affect my dating. I still remember wanting to end it all, hell, those feelings still come back every once in a while. I realised that the more I love myself the easier it is to lose weight. It's also easier to meet guys and have dates. A lot of guys I slept with comment about my weight, but usually it doesn't matter because we've finished the deed by then. I know this will always be my issue... one time a guy even commented on my stretch marks. But, slowly, I realised that if I make it less of an issue the less of an issue it becomes. 

The world is cold and it plagues us with anxieties. I read some of these posts and my heart breaks knowing that so many of you have or are experiencing those awful feelings I had. I just want you guys to know that I'm here and willing to listen. Thank you for reading this.

36,t3_5i3fr6,askgaybros,"Since you fucks keep being completely dumbfounded as to why a gay person would vote for Trump, let me explain.","(*No, I did not vote for Trump. I don't even live in the US.*) 

There exist a very thick, impenetrable partisan thinking in US politics. Blacks should vote democrat, whites should vote republican. Gays should vote democrat. Straights should vote republican. 

This kind of thinking has become by the numbers in the US and its political discussions. It doesn't matter whether you're on Fox or CNN. They all have this fucking idiotic, moronic, view and guess what? 

**It's fucking wrong.** 

You idiots do the same thing. *""HOW COULD A GAY PERSON VOTE FOR TRUMP?!?!!?!? HOOOOOW?!""* is a line I see all the time, without any fucking single thought put into it and you know what? I'm getting tired of seeing stupid gay people not using their brains for once. 

**Positive Things that Trump stand for:**

- He's honest and plain, not two faced like Hillary.

- He's against outsourcing jobs, meaning that a lot of working class people will want to vote for him. 

- He's against rampant immigration, that has lead to massive problems in Europe and is starting to threaten the US. 

- He's politically incorrect and there are so many people tired of hearing that you need to having to censor themselves because sensitive little children (Yes, I'm pointing at you, Askgaybros.) shout and whine at inconsequential things like ""Faggot"" or ""I don't fuck blacks"". 

- Trump supports US culture and unlike his opponent, wasn't a brain damaged cackling hen. Guess what? When people make you proud of who you are, and not shame you for being a white person, or what have you, then they're actually encouraged to vote for them. For me, being gay is a tiny fucking fraction of my personality. My personality is more dictated about me being Swedish and you know what I hate? When swedish politicians say that ""There is no thing such as swedish culture and we need to integrate to the back asswards fucking savagery that is being brought over from the desert."" 

- Unlike Hillary, Trump isn't getting millions of dollars from countries that execute gay people. Yeah, look at that... Russia isn't so fucking bad when compared to Qatar, Saudi-Arabia and other such fucking Muslim states that TOSSES GAY PEOPLE OFF OF TOWERS. When Hillary says she's for gay rights, it's like watching Imperial Japan saying they're pro-jew during WW2. Hillary is actually responsible for helping nations that KILL your and my kind. CONSIDER that for a moment. 

- People like you. Yes, people like you are a HUGE reason why some gay people would vote for Trump. Entitled little pricks who think you can dictate and shout at other people until they do what you think they should do. People who say that you're racist, sexist and whatever have you simply because you don't agree. 

- Many more things, this post is already big enough.

You know what totally sucks? That I have to defend Trump because you morons are so fucking idiotic that you don't actually argue with him on real points. No, you pick non-issues, or issues that Hillary is objectively worse at, which results in him being elected. 

Blame the DNC. Blame yourselves and blame US politics for it having become so fucking partisan that now the electoral college, or the population centers, will always dictate the president elect. 

**AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M MORE ON THE LEFT THAN 99% OF YOU. I THINK THAT RELIGION SHOULD BE ABOLISHED AND I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE A CITIZEN SALARY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE WORK. I THINK THAT ALL DRUGS SHOULD BE LEGAL, I THINK THAT ZOOPHILIA SHOULD BE LEGAL AND I THINK THAT EVEN IDIOTS LIKE YOU SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT NON-ISSUES. SO DON'T FUCKING CLAIM THAT I'M A RIGHT WINGER.**

I have been dating a guy for a month that I met starting Uni this year. It's been amazing so far and he's really pulled me out of my shell. We've been going on dates a couple times a week and sleeping over at each others a bunch of times. Before I met him, I didn't even consider being open and in a relationship. This past weekend we went on a short vacation and spent three nights in another city together. It was the best weekend of my life thus far. 

Today he was speaking to his parents and they invited me to Qatar for Christmas (all paid by them which would be a lot flying from Canada). He hasn't even told them that we're in a relationship, but we think that they must have an idea because of what he has told them about me and all the time we spend together. 

I definitely would love to go and he would love for me to go as well, but I am unsure whether or not it is a good idea to accept. We've talked about it and the possibility that something could happen before Christmas time. In a worst case scenario that would be a break up. But we would still want to go as friends or it could be refunded.

46,t3_ro23fb,askgaybros,My best friend (m19) kissed me (m19) and now I'm confused,"This is my first time on reddit, I installed it just because I couldn't talk to anybody else about it.
Me and my best friend have known each other since we were 7, we played soccer together, we went to the same school and our families are really close too. 
2 days ago we were at my house playing FIFA on my bed, like we always do and we were alone, he lost so I told him he was a loser, he started laughing but he started tickling me (I'm very ticklish and he knows it) and I don't even know how but he basically got on top of me and next thing I knew he was kissing me. I think I might have reciprocated too for a sec but he pulled away and started apologizing without letting me say anything, he literally grabbed his things and ran out of my house. 
I always identified as straight, I had a lot of girlfriends and so did he, but I'm kinda confused about what happened (not just because I didn't know that he was into dudes) because I didn't dislike the kiss at all. I texted him a bunch of times after that but he never replied and I don't really know what to think. I feel so confused about myself and I'm kinda scared what it might mean for me to have liked his kiss. I'm also scared that after this I'm gonna lose him and I don't want to. What should I do?

EDIT: Okay so first of all thanks to everyone who responded here or texted me about it, all of your advices were extremely helpful. 
Today was the 26th and my family and his family spend this day together since me and this guy basically grew up together (along with his older brother) and our parents are really close. 
He texted me last night and apologized for ignoring me and said that we were gonna talk in person today and we did.
We went to my room saying we were gonna play some games and we talked, he told me he's gay but can't come out for different reasons (he is still a soccer player and the team he plays for basically forced him to stay closeted, plus his family is really homophobic and traditional, and that's why I always see him with different girls) and he also told me that he didn't came out to me because he was scared I was gonna react badly and find out that he likes me. He then apologized again for kissing me and said that even if I don't feel the same he wants us to go back to normal and to just pretend it never happened. So I told him that our kiss made me question who I am but that I don't want to give him hope before I'm 100% sure that I like him and we decided to keep things like usual but we're open to do whatever we want or feel like doing when we're together. 
Again thank you for all your help, if things evolve between us I'll probably post another update, happy holidays for those who celebrate and until next time!

47,t3_sk86oc,askgaybros,How do you feel about the Soccer World Cup in Qatar 2022 as a gay person?,"Do you soccer fans out there have mixed feelings about the World Cup being held in a homophobic country? 

Just for context on my thinking:
================================
I’m not particularly a huge soccer fan, I only watch matches like the Eurocup or the Champions with my straight friends at bars (mostly there for booze and the good time); I’m usually quite excited about the World Cups and Olympic Games and the vibe around these events like short documentaries about the host countries, mascots, etc etc. 

I can’t feel the same about Qatar 2022 though. The fact that they still have a death penalty for gay people and some of the direst conditions for LGBT folk really draws my attention away (not to mention their deplorable treatment of migrants and their astonishing lack of women’s rights).

I feel like FIFA is being super hypocritical; on one side they “embrace diversity” and punish those teams or countries with homophobic slurs in their cheering chants, but on the other they hold their World Cup in countries where their laws, THEIR LAWS, state to LITTERALY KILL people for being gay.

I know I shouldn’t mix politics with the game itself, but I simply cannot; up to the point where I’m not interested in following this World Cup at all (maybe boycott, even if this can’t do much).",27,0.92,9,0,9,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/sk86oc/how_do_you_feel_about_the_soccer_world_cup_in/

For starters, my interests are not very stereotypically male I guess. I love music, but I mainly listen to pop and alternative pop, which most straight guys are not that into.

The other big interest I have is videogames, although I don't play online games at all, and even less if it's COD or Fifa or whatever, which are the games that are most popular with guys where I live. And even on the rare ocassion when I might have a common videogame interest, I usually don't follow through...

The root of the problem is that I always feel like I'm gonna end up making them uncomfortable. I want to think that I'm not dramatic per say, but I do have anxiety and depression and am a bit of a high maintenance friendship if I'm being honest. I just tend to talk about my problems to my friends a bit too often and in the culture I live in straight guys are not used to dealing with that stuff and usually don't know what to say. I also worry that if I ever invite one to my house they might feel like I'm gonna get sexual with them and they could not feel comfortable near me. Furthermore, I'm scared that I could cry or something if something bad happened or they made a cruel joke or something. 

The point is that I never try to make my straight friendships deeper even when I have the chance, partly because I don't know how exactly and partly because I fear that I might ruin it and contribute to giving a ""drama queen"" reputation to gays.

My brother (20) and I (17) don't share a lot of the sam interests. For example he's really into sports like all of them - playing, watching, and video gaming them. I'm definitely not, at all. I prefer reading and watching documentaries. That said, I we get along pretty well. He is 110% always there for me, and always has been. He was actually the first person I came out when I was 13. But as supportive as he's always been, we don't really hang out that often just because our interests are so different. 

I've been dating my boyfriend for about 8months now. He shares some of brother's interests, they get along really well, and now they hang out all the time.  My boyfriend was over the house today, and then I had to go out so he stayed to play 1 game of fifa with my brother. When i came back four later they were still playing. 

On the hand im really grateful to have such an accepting and supportive older brother, and I'm glad he and my boyfriend get along. On the other hand I think I'm jealous. When I saw them I wished I enjoyed playing Fifa just so I could do that with my brother or my boyfriend, but then i remember I really don't like Fifa or soccer. Friday afternoon my brother was going to play basketball with some of his friends and they were 1 person short of even teams and so he invited my boyfriend. 

Sometimes I wonder if maybe my boyfriend is the guy my brother wishes was his little brother, instead of me. They certainly would've hung out more. I think the main common interest my brother and I have right now is marvel movies and shows, we watch those together.

60,t3_5vr5fu,askgaybros,Is my family out of line? (Need 3rd party input),"Hi Bros,

So I've become involved in a situation between my boyfriend and my family that I quite frankly need to have someone else take a look at it because all I hear are the two opposing sides in this issue.

First things first. This is the first boyfriend I've moved in full-time with. I recently got a promotion at work, and while new title and more money, a LOT more work and a LOT more hours. The boyfriend lives far closer to my office than my parents did. I'm 26 and he's 34. I work for a major bank, he has a PhD and teaches at a local university. We're two hard working guys who love each other.

Moving out wasn't exactly a clean break. My mother has this attitude that only bad things can happen to her and everyone else is just complaining and needs to suck it up (meanwhile, she's free to bitch all she wants). It ultimately wound up in a rather heated exchange that I just packed up my shit and left.

Since then, we've made peace, but my mother has always had an issue with me being gay. That being said, she's always been pleasant and polite around my previous boyfriends, and largely kept her opinion to herself of whom I was dating.

Last weekend, my parents went on vacation and my brother, my boyfriend and I were going to ""house sit"", which meant getting stoned, playing FIFA, Netflix marathon, that ol' chestnut.

Around the time I met my boyfriend, my brother had an incident that revealed he had been abusing Xanax and drank heavily on top of taking this stuff, for the past 5 years. Which culminated in my parents basically forcing him off of his prescribed medication of Klonopin (he actually suffers from anxiety attacks). About a month or so before the afformentioned incident, he broke up with his girlfriend - yet made multiple attempts to try and win her back, which ultimately wound up in the girl's father having to file a restraining order against my brother. The girl was not my cup of tea, but I was always pleasant to her face.

Flash forward to the weekend we go to my parents place. My brother allegedly had been 20 days clean of taking any anxiety medication. He was just absolutely straight up rude to my boyfriend. He said that my boyfriend is currently ruining my life, and that no one in family likes him. We left my parents place shortly after that.

Since the revelation about my brother's Xanax problem, I tell my parents any and all incidents that occur (I know it's against the brother code, but his well being is at stake). This incident was no different.

This time though, is that my mother tried justifying my brother's actions! Then she started to dig into my boyfriend about how he drinks too much (he drinks, but nothing out of the norm), and that I could do better. The man has a PhD and graduated magna cum laude from Cornell. That aside, he is the sweetest man ever who has ever given me the time of day, centers me far better than anyone in family ever has, and just loves me. I don't really know how much better I can do than that.

My boyfriend is a sweetheart, but no pushover. He has essentially told me he does not like my brother (and who can blame him?). But now there's a strain on the relationship between him and my parents (he knows what my mom said about him).

My family has been testing my patience as time goes on, and even though I'm finally out, they keep needling their way back into my life, and driving me crazy. Any time I try to tell them I'm just trying to live my life (I.e. not showing up every Sunday for dinner), they think I'm rejecting my identity.

I'm sorry if this seems incoherent, but this whole thing has me emotionally exhausted. I don't want to lose my family, but I'm not letting them break us up.

**Tl;Dr - Brother was abusively rude to my boyfriend, mother defended him**

**UPDATE**: Thank you all for your input. you all basically confirmed what I thought was true. I just wanted a fresh perspective to make sure I wasn't looking at it from a biased perspective.

My brother is officially cut off from me until he apologizes to my boyfriend. If it's never, no skin off my nose.

My mother, has basically given up fighting with me and ended today with ""If you're happy, we're happy"".

The relationship between my family and I has dramatically changed (obviously), but they will not dictate to me who I will be with. I love my boyfriend more than anything in this world, and if my family has a problem with taking a back seat to that, tough.

74,t3_sk86oc,askgaybros,How do you feel about the Soccer World Cup in Qatar 2022 as a gay person?,"Do you soccer fans out there have mixed feelings about the World Cup being held in a homophobic country? 

Just for context on my thinking:
================================
I’m not particularly a huge soccer fan, I only watch matches like the Eurocup or the Champions with my straight friends at bars (mostly there for booze and the good time); I’m usually quite excited about the World Cups and Olympic Games and the vibe around these events like short documentaries about the host countries, mascots, etc etc. 

I can’t feel the same about Qatar 2022 though. The fact that they still have a death penalty for gay people and some of the direst conditions for LGBT folk really draws my attention away (not to mention their deplorable treatment of migrants and their astonishing lack of women’s rights).

I feel like FIFA is being super hypocritical; on one side they “embrace diversity” and punish those teams or countries with homophobic slurs in their cheering chants, but on the other they hold their World Cup in countries where their laws, THEIR LAWS, state to LITTERALY KILL people for being gay.

I know I shouldn’t mix politics with the game itself, but I simply cannot; up to the point where I’m not interested in following this World Cup at all (maybe boycott, even if this can’t do much).",27,1.0,10,0,10,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/sk86oc/how_do_you_feel_about_the_soccer_world_cup_in/

94,t3_ld0alr,askgaybros,Should Elite Professional sportsmen be banned from playing if they post Homophobic comments on social media?,"Isreal Falou, who is an Australian born of Samoan heritage and multi football code (has played 3 codes of football at the elite level Rugby League, Australian Rules and Rugby Union) who is a devout Evangelical Christian, was sacked by Rugby Union Australia just prior to the last Rugby World Cup for multiple breaches of his contract (breaches in 2018-19) which stipulated abiding by Rugby Union Australia’s (ARU) social media engagement which is based on the ARU’s diversity and inclusion clause which is in every players contract. ARU has as its biggest sponsor Qantas, which is headed by CEO Alan Joyce, who is an out gay man and other than rugby a big supporter of LGBT causes and he is understood to have placed significant pressure to sack Falou who was a big loss as a player to the Australian Team. An out of court settlement was reached which avoided a high court ruling being established

My favourite Rugby League club St George Illawarra has courted contracting him and this was heavily criticised with good reason. Do you think private tweets should be subject to sanctions in your workplace? While I agree Falou should have been sacked and I would consider not supporting my team of which I have supported since I was 5 yrs old, it does also concern me that if a similar incident went to court it may set a precedent which could potentially be used against LGBT people and considering case law from overseas precedents do get used it could effect potentially a number of countries such as USA, Canada, NZ, UK to name a few. Does that matter to you though or do you think Homophobia should be stamped out even at that kind of risk ???

95,t3_2vxht0,askgaybros,[Update] Planning on coming out to my parents tomorrow...,"I finally did it bros, I'm 25 and I finally did it. 

I was a fucking nervous wreck, I'm telling you. It was like...bordering panic attack.

My parents watched skiing and I joined them at about 8pm but I couldn't get the words out until 11pm or so. I randomly started to get some wine because I was so nervous and poured my father a glass or two as well.  Just about as he was about to go to bed, I spilled it.

I mentioned that I wanted to talk to them about my personal life. My mom sat up in excitement (poor mom, she probably thought I'd gotten a girlfriend...).

They were really accepting, especially my mom. My father asked me some questions and then went back to discussing the skiing world cup. (classic dad)

I bawled like a fucking baby, too, which is what you would expect after you lock in your emotions for so long...I had a really personal talk with my mom afterwards and it felt really relieving.

So I just wanted to write this update post and to honestly thank you bros, from the bottom of my heart, for contributing to this community and helping people every day. I think I couldn't have done this without you.

This is such an awesome community and with your help I managed to finally get my life in order. A year ago this would've been unimaginable for me. My mom actually said she'd been wondering why I was drinking so many glasses of wine without anything to celebrate, lol. Still drunk now.

So thank you again bros, I owe you. ;')",18,0.97,94,0,94,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2vxht0/update_planning_on_coming_out_to_my_parents/
96,t3_8wwp9u,askgaybros,Can I get with an acquaintance of my parents?,"About fifteen years ago, when I was 13, this hairy, well-built dude moved into the house next door to my parents, with his wife and two sons (3 &amp; 5). Until, I was an adult I basically did not directly speak to him, he was a total unknown except for the fact that he was obsessed with his sprinkler system and was constantly out working on it, to keep the grass greener than everyone else's. He was often in the front yard sweaty/soaking wet. Since my bedroom abutted his front yard, this his was obviously a big deal to little closeted 13-year-old me. Not spelling it out, but I had a massive infatuation with him and his body. The only thing we ever bonded over was the 2010 World Cup (me, more for admiration of their shorts) my first summer back visiting from college which did bring out a warm, tactile side of him which once or twice, led to him touching my chest, draping his arm over my shoulders or giving me a hug. We watched several US games together and once with his son in tow. All perfectly innocent. 


Just this afternoon I saw a situation which was what I'm pretty sure was him getting head (or possibly it was just drugs if the other person was doing a line off his thigh or something) in an abandoned school parking lot.  But to boot, the person I later saw get out of his car and into their own was a young dude! Not sure why this wasn't going on in the privacy of his own home but that's not exactly something I engage in regularly. To be clear I have no other important, sustained connection with him other than him being my parents' neighbor and my personal fantasy. He is friendly, but not friends with my parents, nor I his kids. The older of which lives 1,500 miles from home and the younger is spending all but the two weeks before college begins in Spain. His wife and he separated sometime ago, I believe she no longer lives there, which is why it was weird for him not to be participating in this encounter at home.


Bros, I'm not thinking straight right now. Do I play this out? What are the possible ramifications of me making a move on this man? Is there a downside I'm not seeing?

It's fair to say if long posts aren't your thing, then this one probably won't be too. But I promise a hopefully adequate tale as a compromise for a bit of your time.


TW: This story contains themes, such as alcohol/drugs and sex, that may disturb some readers. Discretion is advised. 


This story is intended to be lighthearted, filled with a few laughs, a few tears, a few oohs and aaahs, and a few eewws, but I won't lie, its not an easy walk through the park. In all honesty its just... it's hard to say. I've had a while to mull things over, and though, admittedly, this story feels very r/sadcringe, I have to start somewhere, somehow, so I'll try and explain it to you to the best of my abilities 



Its the summer of my 16th year, I'm in a relationship with the sweetest girl and we had decided to go out with our group of friends and hang out at the mall after school since it was a half day. She said she had this friend she knew and she was gonna introduce me to them because we're apparently very similar and she thought I would've gotten along really well. 


A quick pause; now, you know how theres that saying time stops when you really fall in love with someone? History frequently talks about it, Songs do too. It's in media, in the art we see and shows we watch. It features quite frequently across every major religion or practice in almost every culture. Most, if not all people, generally have that internal capacity to love something, or are able to understand it's concept after decent exposure through a variety of different platforms. You know what I'm talking about; That old souls meeting again type of feeling. That kindred spirits, twin flame, certified by the good heavens, real deal type of feeling. I look back through time to when I first met him to where I am today, and I find myself agreeing with the concept, because it turned out to be true. Oh God it's so true. 


I know its true because I can remember everything about the day I met him (let's call him Mikey). I can remember every single detail about that day, years on; I remember his hair he just dyed to dark red. He had light brown, almond shaped eyes, the type of muscular physique where you could tell the gods had taken time to carve out, and the face that made girls instantly fall in love with him. 


He was wearing a rainbow tie dye shirt, light beige chino track pants, red vans and smelled very very clean. He looked very well groomed, looked after and taken care of, yet as he was approaching us, listening to ""Young wild and free"" from his speaker, he was sporting an extremely red and extremely bloodshot eye. 


He says hello, and we introduce ourselves to each other when he looks immediately at my hand; he had just sent the group chat a picture of a pair of Butterflies that had landed on his hand shortly before he started walking up to me, my girlfriend, and the rest of our group of friends when, sure enough, two Butterflies had landed on mine. We both noticed them and we laugh, and it wasn't long after that we immediately become good friends.


Fast forward 6 months to my birthday, I had been broken up with a week previously and he had invited me out to help me get over her seeing as it was hitting me pretty hard. We would've been going on our get away for my 17th which I eventually didn't want to after we split up. The experience was new, and fresh, and was my first taste of heartbreak.


Mikey invites me out and we get our hands on some alcohol, we drink and get to know more about one another; He's into various styles of dance, he can sing, he's a bit of a gamer and a secret nerd, likes halo, the star wars universe and lord of the rings. He gyms and plays rugby sometimes for his school. He is unaware that he can speak about and understand philosophy, biology, music, physics and psychology at a university level but doesn't want to pursue academics yet and just wants to get money as soon as possible so he's starting work soon. We were both spiritual. He was reading the Art of War in English Class and his favourite movie is The Notebook, especially the scene where they both die peacefully in each other's arms when they both finally realize who each other were and how deep their love was. He's was sorted into Gryffindor on Pottermore while I was a Slytherin, but he always wanted to be a Hufflepuff because his favourite color and house colors at school were Yellow, where as I wanted to be in Hufflepuff because they were the nicest. He was raised in the hood so there definitely was some street influence with him but he was polite and motivating. He ran super fast, would box and watch MMA, and he loved hugs. He was a golden retriever in a human body, very sweet, very playful, very loyal and very protective.


In many ways we were exactly the same; we both had the same taste in music, danced the same styles, had the same general belief in anything to do with spirituality and we were both young and a little bit nerdy. We had our differences too, I was more into academics and He was more into sports, he loved parties and drinking, I liked being indoors with a game and a blunt to smoke, but we were both bonding about pretty much everything while also getting drunk. 
Very drunk. Very quickly. 



He suddenly tells me how he also broke up with his girlfriend too and it shook him to his core. He explains about his red eye that day I met him, the girl he was seeing was in trouble. He was crying, pouring his heart out, telling me how he protected her and their friends from being attacked, how much he loves everyone but also how hard he's taking it at the moment too, and that it's finally good to have someone to talk about things like his vulnerabilities and how easily it is to relate to me because we both kinda share the same trauma of heartbreak.


He cries and he hugs me, sobbing into my shoulder 


Before I know it I can feel tears running down my cheeks at a rapid speed; I feel his sadness very clearly, it's the same as what I'm feeling. We both lost someone of significance, even though it was only for a few months, it feels like our hearts were being thrown left right and centre. I tell him how I met my girlfriend through one of our mutual friends, and had told me she didn't think she was the right one for me. I really did love her. I just couldn't understand when we both were a really good match. We worked well together, I adored her, but I still wasn't enough.


He lifts his head to meet my own. 


We're nose to nose now, his lips are just brushing against mine.


We hear a knock on the door and stop, stunned at what we were doing. 
We both agree we've both had enough to drink, we thank his mom for bringing us blankets to the mancave, and set about falling asleep with me crashing on the couch against the wall and him on the other couch, his hand just out of reach. 


Later I had accepted that I had attraction to the same sex and that I was definitely into dudes. It started with me thinking maybe this was just a one off, a stolen kiss, a rare chance encounter, nothing to ever expect ever again. I mean why would I even get a chance, he's an attractive 17 year old jock. He's a lady killer, girls are lining up to get a chance to even look at him and, listen yall, I get it, I really do. He's straight. He's a jock. He plays sports with his intimidating jock friends who I kinda suspect don't like me. He's straight and that's final. I can't change that. And any ways what were the chances of me ever getting to actually have a chance with him, anyway?



By 18, I come out and we still remain friends throughout the years. Some exes come and go, one in particular, let's call him Luke, treated me horribly, abused me to the point I'm sent to the hospital and Mikey, despite never meeting him, swears to avenge me for what he did to me.


One morning Mikey messages me and tells me that he's worried he thinks he's bi; He tells me he had a dream that night of having sex with a man and that he liked it, that he woke up aroused and panicked because this was a completely new and rather terrifying feeling for him. He came to ask me for advice, clarity, and guidance, so I told him maybe it could be a phase, that it was just a dream, to not worry about it because he hasn't expressed any interest in men before, and me explaining that seems to calm him down. 


I personally didn't want to take advantage of him and manipulate him into believing he likes dudes when he's facing a sexual identity crisis, not only is that horrifically wrong and definitely falls under grooming behavior it also genuinely didnt feel right in my soul to do that. If I truly loved him, then I could love him without trying to manipulate him into being attracted to men, and have an opportunity to do more than share a fleeting kiss we probably would regret. If I loved him, I should let him go. 


And so friends we remained. My feelings deepening with every message from him, every interaction and every time we hang out. There was a point where we were hanging out every single day during the summer holidays. And even though I was getting along with his family as much as anyone could (they even considered adopting me and taking me under their wing at one stage when I had a massive argument with my guardian at the time), there were times I'd overstay my welcome trying to be close to him and after realizing I wasnt helping my emotions when I wanted to be near him all the time, spoiling something when it was already a good thing, that maybe I was being too clingy, too hopeful. I had to begin to distance myself respectfully.


Both of us are 21 by now with me still actively trying to get over him, date other people, keep occupied by spending time with friends and family, commitments etc, when one night out of nowhere he sends me nudes. 


I wont go too into details but I was very...surprised...to say the least. 


I guess he was feeling daring, we were both single, and we may have indulged in a bit of flirting previously, but I honestly thought it was just banter, I didn't know that this was allowed in a friendship. 


He wanted to clarify he's not gay, and I believe him even to this day, but he made a move. He actually made a move on me. This was an unexpected yet welcome turn of events. 


But now things are getting confusing to me. With him knowing full well I have an attraction to men, I've even drunkenly confessed my romantic attraction towards him before (he declines a little too harshly in the past but we eventually got over it), he's telling me he's straight and he's only dating girls, yet he's comfortable sending nudes to me? 


At some point during the conversation him and I are having about his clearly impressive progress at the gym I'm finding myself throwing the rule book out. I'm finding myself thinking maybe I do have a chance after all, because the next night he invites me over. And that's when I decide to test the waters. 


It's just him and I hanging out in the mancave, and I make sure we don't drink or get high this time, I want to see if that is just drunk Mikey being a flirt, or if this is the real Michael that maybe has feelings for me too. 


Something is playing on the TV, I can't remember what exactly, it could've been some playlist on Youtube or a movie on Netflix, but we're sitting on our usual opposite couches when he gets up to go get something to eat from the fridge in the mancave when I pull him over to me and hug him. 


But this time, its not like any of the other hugs I've given him.


This time, I'm holding him. I'm trying to put every single unsaid word, every ounce of love I had for him in that one embrace. He makes a joke that this is pretty gay, which makes us both start laughing so much we can barely stop, him and I still holding onto each other. I tell him I know, and continue pouring myself into this moment with him. Maybe he understands, maybe he's feeling it too, because he slowly starts brushing my neck with his thumb, his muscles holding me tightly. Next thing I know he's turning off the TV, announces it's time for bed for the both of us, and leads me by hand to his sleepout. 


I ask where the spare mattress is and for bedding, seeing as he only has the one bed in his room and I didn't want him to be uncomfortable sharing a bed with me. He says its not a problem, for me to get over myself and just climb in. He starts to strip down, taking off his shirt and pants, down to his underwear and demands I do too with smile that looks too mischievous. I'm whipping my clothes off so fast I trip and fall right on to the ground, showing more submission than I intended. We both laugh as he pulls me off the ground, throws me on the bed and pins me down, locking his legs over me, grinning in triumph, winning the battle of strengths. Then he looks at me and, even though there's only the streetlight illuminating his face and his chest, I see a hue of a blush appear on his cheeks and tops of his ears. One thing leads to another and...


It was...awkward, kinda funny at times now that I think about it, we both had no idea what we were doing, but it felt natural and honest. He liked being jerked off, sometimes blowjobs, hated hands near his butt but loved back rubs, I liked kisses and cuddles, cutesy stuff. He gave me a hickey and I was even able to get a post sex pic of us just holding eachother, just him laying across my chest, arms wrapped around me. This was what I wanted my own personal heaven to be. Him and I, embracing each other.


It would be the first of many experiences with him, always on the low since he wasn't out and didn't plan on being, and I respect his decision not to be out, with him still not knowing exactly what he was, if he was straight or bi or whatever. I knew the struggles of being out, and was in no rush for him to struggle with the process of being out either. He'd toy with the idea of sexuality while experimenting with me, always unsure but not unwilling to ask for sex when we were both down for it. 



One day, we have a disagreement and he stops messaging me. I'm trying to get ahold of him, but he deletes every one of his socials. 
I was too pushy and demanding, too obsessed and too clingy, too confrontational when I wanted to talk about what we were doing, unaccepting of his answers when all he was doing was genuinely exploring his sexuality as opposed to me who was trying too hard to romantically connect to the man whom I had allowed to consume my mind, heart, body and soul. I was too much, too intense, too in love. He didn't message me for quite some time after that fight. 




I remember partying a lot around my mid 20s, drinking alot, smoking a lot of weed, and I'm working now. I'm earning quite a lot, was even promoted into a managers position, but I'm still trying everything in my power to get over Mikeys absence. 


I had just started dating a genuinely fun and interesting dude who we'll call Zed. He was intelligent, traveled, fashionable, and very, very attractive. He encouraged me to continue to work hard and better myself in every aspect of life, but was also very vain and indulgent in the pleasures of the world like sex and drugs. He also wasn't looking for a boyfriend, and despite my attempts at trying to establish a romantic tie with him he would only want something less. Despite all of this, he still had genuine care for those who were close to him, me included, which was one of the many things I respected about that guy; he was honest from the start about his intentions and behavior, and he's someone I consider a friend even to this day. 


I was at work one day when Mikey messages me saying he's sorry for everything. He's sorry for confusing me. He's sorry for being so shady with his sexuality and had come to the conclusion he's not 100% straight and I immediately apologize for being too overwhelming, for being too needy, and getting my emotions involved. 
Zed tells me to go for Mikey because he obviously means something to me, and not to worry about him as he'll be okay. 


Mikey tells me to come over as soon as possible so I make my way to his after my shift ends.
I arrive when I see him in his car and he looks defeated, like hes changed. somethings up, something not good. I can tell because now he has a big scar cutting across the middle of his throat, sort of in the shape of a scythe. I try to hug him but he's not hugging me back which is odd behavior, even for him. 


He asks if I want to go out, so he takes me for a drive and we go to the park, he buys us lunch and we sit in the car with our meal, him looking nervous as he tries to eat and observing the rain that has now started to fall upon the windscreen. 


I ask him how he's been, what's he been up to, and he looks me dead in the eye, evidently fighting back tears that are building, and looking at me so intensely Im surprised I notice that the rain has gotten even louder. 
He tells me he had recently became very close friends with the abusive ex, Luke, that sent me to hospital. 


I froze. 


He tells me he met Luke when Mikey and him started selling drugs. Some enemy drug dealer came to attack Mikey, for reasons I still am unsure of. Mikey ended up dying in hospital, and was brought back to life. The rain is coming down harder.


My heart sank, I have no way of tracking exactly how far, but it's falling, no, plummeting downwards. 


He said he ended up getting drunk one night and ended up having sex with Luke. 


And oddly, I started laughing. 


Maniacally, crazily, and completely unhinged.
Im trying to get a sense of the surroundings but I'm so dizzy, I just keep laughing because of course it would happen. Of course the truer definition of heart break is this. Of course I had to experience the pure madness of heartbreak again, but in such a way that really imprints a sense of irreversible damage, this sadness is beyond the tears falling down my face. 


After a while I just stop and try to gather myself while he just looks down, looking like the thing he dreaded would happen, happened. 


He said he wanted to take me out to make it up to me so he drives me out to a bar, me still trying to process everything. He tries to get me to drink so we can be like how we were in the good ol days but I'm just completely in shock. I was highly uncomfortable and just wanted to sink into the earth and die. 


I could tell he was trying to make it up to me, heavily flirting with me, this time more intensely and showing off every single feature I once loved about him but all I could think about, all I could feel was heartbreak. This is what heartbreak was. It wasn't just a high school romance gone awry after a few months.. it was this pure anguish, served deliciously cold and empty for me to experience.


It's while hes trying to make me smile and failing miserably, when we both see Luke walk in and make a bee line straight for Michael. He doesn't even see me, and Michael looks at me with panic as he sees my face turn from pure sadness to deranged anger. Michael coughs and says he's kinda busy talking with someone, when Luke finally notices me and jumps back. 


He asks how we know each other


And I say he's been my friend for years. 


Now Luke is frozen. 


He asks Michael if I know about what happened. 


And before Michael gets the chance to say anything, I answer for him. 


I say I do, and ofcourse I do, because Micahel tells me everything, we're best friends. 


Luke looks horrified. Michael looks ashamed. Both of them looking very hurt. 


Luke is left screaming for Michael to forever keep his name out of his mouth and mind while I grab his keys and we leave the bar. But as we are leaving he grabs his keys out of my hands, rushes into the driver's seat, locks the door, and begins to start the car. He says we're staying at his and he'll drive us. I try and tell him not to because he's drunk but he's already starting to drive off, so I get in and we're both gone. He starts driving, I'm still trying to gather the events of the day together when I notice that he's starting to gain speed, and he's starting to go faster. 


And faster. 


And faster. 


I can feel panic set in as we're driving through oncoming traffic and redlights. 
His eyes are fixed on the road as he just plows through, well above the speed limit and tears flowing down his face as he looks as if he's filled with a thousand years worth of rage. 


I'm begging for him to stop, not knowing if I was going to die or not, experiencing the daze of flashing colors, music at the max but just audible over the roaring engine and the beeping from other concerned drivers


And within the blink of an eye we have shot from the city all the way back to his, Him and I both breathing heavily. 


He says he's sorry, but before he could say more I get out of the car and slam the door shut, walk into the mancave, where I collapse on his sofa, and find myself shaking furiously, is it anger? adrenaline? shock? I'm so very confused after the events of today. 


At some point I hear him shut his car door, but he doesn't come into the mancave, instead he goes toward his sleep out so I reach out for the blanket I usually stash in one of the draws, see it's still there after all this time, pull out a blanket and fall asleep. And the second I wake up and ask a friend to come pick me up, i leave the first thing in the morning.


And we don't talk for about a year but one day I, as usual, get a message from him but through his sister to message him. 


I'm about to graduate, I'm single, and finally straightening things out in my life. I'm pretty hesitant to, considering the confusing ride this all has been, but I give him one more chance. 
He comes over to mine and I'm a bit standoffish, my trust is limited at the moment with him but I agree to see him, guards fully up and well equipped to handle the eventual mess that will be made this time round. 


He comes over but hes still behaving differntly; he's very flirty, very confused, and I can smell alcohol. He goes from telling me how sorry he is, to telling me how much he loves me, to telling me how much he'll hurt and destroy me, and that he has something to tell me. He no longer sells drugs, and is looking at moving countries to live with his brother and start a better life. Honestly, he's a bit of a mess, hasn't showered and looks like he's going through a crisis and not handling it very well.


I tell him he's drunk and should probably have something to eat and get some sleep, i show him where the couch is, I tell him to sleep this off and send him off for a shower while I make his bed. He finishes, I give him his snack, say good night and go for my shower, and come back to find him in my bed, wishing me luck trying to get him to sleep somewhere else. I groan with annoyance, because, knowing him, i won't win battle of strengths, a mixture of its not worth fighting tonight and i climb into bed with him. 


He tries hugging me and I let him. 
I don't know why I'm allowing myself to do this. He's drunk, and I'm obviously still hurt about everything. Suddenly I find both of his hands cupping my face as he looks at me and smiles. And then he kisses me. Not a soft kiss, not like our first. This time, its passionate, and deep, like hes trying to express everything in that one moment, everything that I mean to him. 



So this is what its turned into. I knew I'd fall for it again and be charmed by him but I let it happen, anyways. And again, it ended up making things a little more complicated. The signs of an unhealthy relationship were there, both if us evidently aware of it, so why were we still coming back together time and time again? And why is it whenever he comes back something happens?



In the morning, he's sitting with me having breakfast when my family comes and see us. They all have big grins, congratulating me for finally being in the relationship of my dreams and him for finally coming out which he quickly denies. 


There was an awkward silence as he looks at us with convincing defiance, like he's deeply and truly upset with the suggestion that he could ever be interested in men when he gets up suddenly and starts to leave. 


I don't hear from him for about 2 months when I start to get sick. 
I go to the doctors and find out I may have an STD and seeing as the only person I've ever had unprotected sex with was Michael, I need to tell him. 


I get into contact with him, tell him he may need to get checked as well, when he tells me what he was supposed to tell me when I last saw him; He was in a relationship with a girl and she was pregnant. 


And now I'm back to when my heart was broken, that same gut wrenching, soul crushing, heart break that I hate feeling so much, especially when it comes to, or from, him. 


But I'm more prepared for this now. I put on a front, wishing him the best, while also reminding him to get checked, him telling me that he already has been, and that's the last time I heard from him. 


Today, I'm close to 30 and I have settled down, I have a healthy relationship with a fantastic guy who I honestly and truthfully adore. I'm a social worker, focused on helping at risk youth while my partner is a high school teacher, talks of marriage and kids are beginning to be discussed, life is simple and honestly, things are starting to go it's course. The rest is yet to be written, but I'm finding peace now.


I guess after all this, if you even managed to fully read it all, you may be wondering what the point to this was, if it was just another take on a predictable love trope that has been done before, if I had a secret crush on a dude and found out I was definitely into guys by falling in love with my best friend, that wouldn't exactly be the full and one hundred percent truth. Neither would it be true if I said I'm completely over the whole situation. I guess it's hard to explain.


I did see him out the other day, just last month with his baby, holding onto something with his daughters' tiny hands in his as they sat on the outside tables, two butterflies had landed in their hands. It was the happiest I've ever seen him in a very, very, very long time, and in all honesty I'm glad he's found a girl he can truly adore.",29,0.86,31,0,31,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/wskomw/i_found_out_i_was_into_men_by_experimenting_with/
110,t3_nh58ih,askgaybros,"I just finished writing my ""Coming Out"" letter to my family and friends. Can any of my gaybros take a look and see if its OK, if it could be improved in any way?","Hello to all my gaybros,

This is my first open post on Reddit and I am nervous and excited to get some advice from the community. I am a 30 yo gay male who still lives with his father and little sister and I have battling with my sexuality for 15 years of my life. I live in the UK, London. I finally feel ready to come out to my family and friends, but for me its a double whammy, as not only am I coming out as gay, but demisexual too.

I hope you can read the below letter below and give me any advice if it could be improved or changed in any way at all. It's quite long, so I apologize, but hope you enjoy it.

Here it is......

  **The Hardest Letter I Have Ever Written In My Life**  
 **Written by mpkio**

**(TRIGGER WARNING: My emotions and thoughts. Sorry if anyone gets upset at all,)**

To all my family and friends,  
  This is probably gonna be the hardest letter I have ever written in my life. I am nervous and scared beyond all believe, but despite that, excited and ready for what is to come next. As most of you already know, I have slowly gone around and broke some important news surrounding myself to each and every one of you. **I am gay and demisexual.** I am writing this long letter to you all to explain some aspects about myself and how I have come to learnt all this information, how I have struggled and dealt and, finally, accepted myself for who I am.

Please be assured that this information is what I want to share with you all; this is the most comfortable way for me to explain this all to you as I’m better with written words than spoken words (I would just get too nervous and stumble over my words lol). Anyway, I’m comfortable to disclose all this, so don’t worry.

So, I hope you’re sitting comfortably, got a cup of tea or coffee, or another drink (Russell and Jason!) and a few snacks, because this might be a long one lol. OK, here I go……*\*Deep breathe\**

**Part I**  
 **Struggles and Questions**

So, first things first; “When did I find out I was gay?” You get some people in the LGBT community who say “I always knew,” kinda thing……and for some that applies to, but for me, it’s kinda like…….well…..confusing…….cause I also learnt another part of myself too (Demisexual) which kinda conflicted with it. What do I mean by that? Well growing up I never experienced any sexual attraction to a single person, male or female. Even when I was in primary school and girls wanted me as a boyfriend, I felt not a thing in return, but I just thought “Oh, maybe it’s supposed to feel like this,”. Well, then friends started to talk about who they liked as I grew into my teenage years and talked about how they liked certain girls. I just nodded my head and agreed, though I felt nothing at all. But what was weird is that I still felt nothing for guys either. This started to make me worry, thinking something definitely was wrong with me……

And so, enter all the struggles and questions and an internal battle of emotion and confusion took over, like a storm that raged in my head that no-one but myself could see and feel and experience, but to everyone else on the outside, I was just going about doing normal things, like nothing was wrong. Now, please, don’t take any of this personal and ask me why I never approached anyone if I was feeling this way; this was something *I* had to deal with, to figure out and battle on by *myself*. This is nothing personal against anyone at all, so please don’t feel or think anything like this. 

So, as teenage-hood continued to pass, I soon started to feel certain feelings to other guys, but quickly brushed them away like they were never there. I just thought “Nope I never thought nothing like that,” and “I bet all other guys think like this too, right?” Nothing but inner denial took over my head and this battle against myself still continued to rage on and on. I battled on but my feelings could not be denied of what I like and yet while this is going on, still no celebrity crushes. None, nada, no crushes on my friends or anyone, and while this was going on, I felt more alone than ever before.

Now, all this was going on in the mid 2000’s where the internet was hardly a big thing – there was no community for me to go and talk about all these feelings to – there was no forums I could talk to people who were also feeling the same thing – there was no place where I could go get advice, to talk to someone who felt the same way, to be part of a community where I belonged. I mean imagine, me a teen in the mid 2000’s asking someone “I haven’t had a crush on anyone. Is that normal?” What do you think the response would be? Probably something like “Oh don’t worry, you will get a crush soon; it will hit you outta nowhere,” Right? Could I ask it to anyone? No, cause I never seen/heard anyone feel the same way as me, and thus the answer I would get would be from someone who *has* had a crush on someone; I needed the opposite; someone who had never had a crush on someone. And back then, Asexuality wasn’t much talked about in the normal open space and hadn’t really entered the human consciousness. So, I couldn’t ask anyone, and the confusion continued in my head.

**Part II**  
 **Denial Of the Truth**

So I knew who and what I was into (Ummmm……“men on the internet” \*cough\*) but still no attraction to anyone. I entered college and still all this confusion is going on in the back of my head and I’m ignoring it like it’s not there at all. *“Just look normal,”* I said to myself. *“Blend in and just look normal like everyone else,”* Now, for me, I am very “straight passing” guy so I can get away without causing any suspicions about my sexuality as I always got the question “Do you have a girlfriend?”, people assuming I’m straight, when in fact I’m not. “Straight passing” basically means I had all the connotations of a “straight male”. So I could pass off as “straight male” to keep up appearances as it were. Of course, I felt terrible doing so as it felt like I was lying to myself and to all the people around me, like I was allowing people to think I was a certain way, when in fact I wasn’t. But I pushed it away as quickly, not thinking about it at all, not wanting to face and accept a part of me that was there…….has always been there. 

It was easier to lie to myself than to face the truth that was right there, screaming in the back of my head, like a voice, a thing that could never be washed away, no matter how hard I tried to squish it away.

It was there, always in the back of my mind……

I entered university and experienced some of the greatest days of my life with friends, feeling free and experiencing new things. Of course, some of my fellow students were “out of the closet” and were LGBT ; from gay, lesbian and bisexual. And maybe I could have “come out” to one of them….maybe I could have indulged my feelings, emotions and confusion to someone, anyone. 

But no. I said nothing.

I just continued as I always had been from then; keep looking “normal”, continue on as always, ignore those feelings, push them down and ignore it, deny it like nothing was there, despite my inner voice yelling at me. To me, it felt like something I “didn’t need to confront – didn’t need to face it and figure out,” – To me, it was nothing. I just ignored it. All for appearances, cause if anyone finds out, then it’s over for you; you can’t let anyone know….you don’t even know yourself! So, still confused, yet leaning more to myself being gay, I graduated university with nothing but a make out session from a girl that I had no sexual attraction to lol.

Life went on. I watched movies; I watched the Marvel movies and started to secretly like how certain male heroes…..um……“looked” (You all know what I mean ) but again, continue on, don’t address it, ignore it, run away and just go on without facing it. Inside, the battle was slowly coming down, thank god, but still I was not facing it at all. I felt like I was a coward, like I just couldn’t accept that part of myself because of what everyone around me would think and society as a whole; “How could you not tell me?” “Don’t you trust me?” “Why didn’t you tell me?”

No.

I could not face that and feel like I had lied to everyone around me.

No.

I could not face everyone’s judgemental faces and unconvinced expressions…..

“Are you sure you’re gay? You don’t look it……you don’t act it…….”

No, no, no……

Just ignore it all. 

**Part III**  
 **The Road To Acceptance** 

Oh, it may come across like I was crying in bed or something; no, none of that ever happened lol. This is just what I thought right in the back of my head that never, ever surfaced in anyway. On the outside, I was going through life just normal. 

Enter the year 2013 things were getting better on the outside world and on the internet. Gay marriage passed, there was more representation in TV and movies I watched, more discussion on LGBT issues on TV and Pride Month was celebrated in June in the UK. Forums and advice places opened up and I looked up questions I had always wondered about myself, questions that had battled within myself were finally making more sense, answers coming to the surface; I found like-minded people and with it, a place and a community. 

And as all this was occurring, I started to tackle those questions I was so afraid of. I had support from a community and I knew that, although I might not like the answers I find, I needed to face them. And so, I asked forums questions I needed answers to and I slowly trailed answers on my computer screen and I slowly took it all in, deconstructing them and how it could all fit in my life, and all too nicely, it all fitted into place.

And so, to go back to the original question that was posed but at the beginning of “Part I”, “When did I find out I was gay?” The answer is, I don’t know. Which is the truth. Because its only when I look back on my life, looking back in retrospect do I realize that I was always gay and that, for me, there was no “moment of discovery” however weird that may sound. All I know is that I have been battling with a confused mind for about 15 years or so, around when I was 15 or so, so that might be my “awakening” as it were lol. 

So, for me, it was a slow confusing battle within myself. I finally accepted myself and who and what I am around 2018, yet I still had not revealed it to anyone; not one person at all. I was still terrified of everyone’s reactions, and so I just left it be…….for now.

**Part IV**  
 **Loving Myself**

So, we forward to 2020 and covid hits, and I’m in lockdown and quarantine, with more free time. I had finally accepted my sexuality and come to terms with it all, but still a question boggled in my mind that I had not bothered to confront; “Why don’t I get crushes on any guys?” Surely, I should have gotten a crush by now?

Well, I got my answer soon enough after I joined Discord and made some friends in a LGBT+ Server. I asked questions that confused me, why I felt no attraction to anyone? They asked if I liked relationships and if I ever wanted to be in one myself and I thought and answered “Yes,” and that “I like to see a relationship slowly build before anything sexual would occur,” 

And then, I got my answer…..

The confusion that plagued me like a sickness for most of my life, had vanished, was cured from my body…..

**I’m demisexual**, which is on the Asexual spectrum. 

Basically, Demisexual people only feel sexually attracted to someone when they have an emotional bond with the person. They can be gay, straight, bisexual, or pansexual, and may have any gender identity. 

The prefix “demi” means half — which can refer to being halfway between sexual and asexual. Demisexuality can be a type of graysexuality. A graysexual person may experience sexual attraction only rarely, or they may feel sexual attraction but aren’t that interested in sex.

Demisexual people do not feel primary attraction — the attraction you feel to someone when you first meet them. They only feel secondary attraction — the type of attraction that happens after knowing someone for a while.

What the term means to me is that I only feel sexual attraction to someone, only after I get to know them on a deep level through interests and traits. Its not that I have “high standards” or “choosing not to do anything sexual with someone,”, it just that I can’t physically do it. Something tells me in my brain “No, you can’t do that! You wanna get to know them first!” Its strange to explain and all, and maybe hard for someone who doesn’t feel like this to understand fully, but that’s just who I am.

After finding out the term that best described a part of me I had always wondered, I came across Asexuality.org, the world’s biggest asexual open forum on the internet, and talked to other asexual people about their experiences.

And then everything just fell into place.

*At last.*

I finally had all my answers, and I had accepted them and, ultimately, myself.

**Part V - Epilogue**  
 **A Bright Future Awaits**

And so, here I am writing this letter, on the 20th of May 2021 at midnight. It’s a cool night outside, but all I can feel is heat as my heart pumps blood around my body, both nervous, scared and excited that you are all finally reading this, that you all know what I had (Very deeply, shallowly,) been thinking about, been battling with for half of my life.

Right now, I’m more comfortable, confident and happy with myself.

I finally feel ready to let you all know a part of me I had been battling with, that was always there from the day I was born. I’m still me; I’m still a son, a grandson, a nephew, a brother, a uncle and a friend to you all. You just now know a part of me that you didn’t before lol

I am nothing but grateful to have you all in my life; and I don’t know what the reactions will be, but I want you all to deal with this information in your own time. For some of you, it might take some time to work out and I’m absolutely fine with that. Take all the time you need; it took me 15 years to figure this stuff out after all xD

Please approach me, talk to me, text, message, call, talk to me in open, anything you are comfortable with; I do not mind. You can ask almost any question you want and I would be more than happy to discuss it with any of you :D

What’s next? Who knows?

But this is where I’m signing out for now.

I’m gay and demisexual……

And that’s just fine. 

Much love to you all &lt;3

114,t3_ke86um,askgaybros,My girlfriend and my gay side,"So, 
I consider myself a straight male. But i have leanings towards cock. They just look so juicy and hard. I usually masterbate to shemale porn. Best of both worlds really. 
I never really considered being with an actual man until i tried cocaine. Id been with 4 trans girls, 3 from the internet and one thai hooker.

I had to get pretty drunk to do the three shemales in australia. I did the thai hooker on coke. The first shemale was the best one. That was 2013 i think. I fucked her twice. I remember lying on her bed on my back and she was sitting on me. I reached and felt her hard cock through her leggings. That was soooo fucking hot. I was really drunk. I pushed her on her back and sucked her pretty dick. It tasted so good. I fucked her and she fucked me for a little bit misionary. It kind of hurt a little and i was too drunk to really really enjoy it. She told me my ass was loose. I was desperate to get fucked. I think i was too drunk to cum.
I think it was the second time that i asked her to cum in my mouth. She did. I dont entirely remember what it tasted like. I drank it down quick.
I fantasize about her a bit. 

After id been with her she started hooking. When i started coke i messaged her and she sent me videos of her playing with her cock. So hot to watch
I got a bit carried away a couple of times when i was high and she stopped talking to me. 
One night i was high and decided to go to her work and try to be a client. I sobered up and didnt go. 


Being on coke flips some bitch switch inside me. Its so strange. I started sending random guys in other countries i met online pictures and video of me cross dressing and playing with my dildos. I really enjoyed feeling like a little slut. I didnt want to see them at all at first. I even cammed a couple of guys and they just watched. Id send videos of just my mouth sucking dildos and calling the guys daddy and begging for their cock. 
Once i tried to get two different guys to watch me play with myself. Didnt quite work. 


One night at the start of the year i got super high and went on grinder with  picture of my open mouth and tried to find a guy to blow. I didnt want to talk to the guy or see them much in real life. So i got one guy to meet me in the bushes at a park and told him to just let me suck his dick and then just go. 
I was very high and still a little nervous. I walked into the park, found some bushes, got on my knees and waited. A couple of minutes later the guy walked in and pulled his cock out. I was like fuck it just do it. I sucked his cock for a while. It was average size and tasted fine. I cupped his balls while i sucked. He was breathing heavy but was pretty quiet. Then i jerked him while i licked the head of his cock and he came on my tounge. I let it drip out of my mouth and a bit went on my shirt. It was hot. He left. I waited a few minutes and quickly left. 

I went home and was excited. I messaged him on grinder and asked him how he liked my first headjob given to a man. He said it was good but to use less teeth next time.
I was still high and excited that id managed to have the courage to try something strange to me so i went back on grinder and found another guy to blow.

I found a guy that said he was housesitting in rosebud or near there and said to come over, let myself in, he'd be on the couch with a pillow over his face, id blow him then go. He also asked me to get him a slurpy on the way oddly. I did. I got to what i thought was the house. Lights were all off, he messaged and said to just walk in the front door. But there was a buch of couches and junk in the way i couldnt get around. I messaged him to come out but he said no just come in. 
I got a bit freaked out so i drove off. I left his slurpy near the letterbox. I messaged him to tell him. He was like theres no slurpy come back, so i must have gone to the wrong house. Better to be safe.

Also i have frequently had std checks.
Not that ive been that sexually active. 

I connected with an old friend earlier this year that id had a fling with a few years ago. She is wonderful. I have only shared my sort of gay leanings with one of my girlfriends 10 years ago. She was supportive and we pegged a few times. 
Sice then i havnt been close enough with the girls ive been with to admit my other side  
At the start of the year i reconnected with a girl id had a fling with a few years ago. 
We quickly became close and i decided id confess to her that i liked being pegged. Surprisingly she was totally fine with it. Offered to buy a strapon and use it on me. I was so relieved. 

She then was nervous and said i needed to know something if we were going to get serious. 
She told me that before covid hit she spent nearly two years working as a prostitute in a brothel. 
I was pretty shocked, she seemed like the last kind of girl who would do that. 
I took a day to process it and realised she was a fantastic girl and it didnt change anything. 

We started dating and everything was fantastic. 
One night we did coke together and i confessed all the other things id done sexually and what i liked. 
She was also fine with that.
I really like this girl but i also want to explore more of my gay side.

116,t3_3iemuu,askgaybros,My recent experiences at German group sex parties [AMA],"First off I realize this post isn’t going to be everyone’s cup of tea. And I fully expect some “slut shaming” to follow, but I’ve been a part of this community for years (under a different username) so I wanted to share my experience with you guys and give you a chance to ask questions. When I was researching this stuff it was difficult to find first hand accounts of what goes on at events like this so maybe it will help someone someday. Now if you live in Germany or other more sexually liberal areas of the world this post might not be news to you. But seeing as most of us are in the US I figure it might be eye opening.

A few weeks ago I was visiting Berlin and attended a few group sex events. When I say group sex I mean events in bars and attended by hundreds of guys each night. I attended these events with a friend I was traveling with. I speak no German, but that was never a problem. Everyone I talked to was always friendly and polite and spoke English just fine.

First I attended an event simply called “Fuck Friday” at a place called Laboratory. If you want to attend you must arrive in a two hour window between 10p-12a.  If you don’t get there in time too bad. Once the doors close the party goes on all night. Upon entry you pay something like 6 Euro and are handed a bag and a number on a tag. You move to the side and undress and put everything in your bag. Some people were naked others opted to keep on underwear, jock, leather or other sexual gear, but no street clothes. Shoes are mandatory. High athletic socks are recommended. You give your bag to the attendant who writes your number on your shoulder in a sharpie. That number gets you your clothes back. 

The first area has some slings and such that no one was using. Past that is a large bar area where everyone is just hanging out, drinking, and relaxing. Naked. When you order a drink the bartender keeps a running tab by the number on your shoulder and when you leave you get your clothes and wallet and pay. I get my drink and hang just observe the room with my friend.  We notice that most people there are actually with friends too just hanging out like any group of friends would at a bar on a Friday night. The ages and types were all over the place.  I was actually surprised at how young the crowd was in general. I’d say most people were 25-45 and in good shape too. It was hardly a bunch of a old naked men like I had imagined.

We take our drinks and walk around. It’s still early and no one is doing too much just yet but you know that will change. This place is massive.  The building is actually an old power substation and has a true “dungeon” feel to it.  There are slings, gloryholes, mats/beds, piss play areas etc everywhere. There are second floor areas with additional play spaces overlooking the bar. All of it is public viewing.  There really is no place to hide here. There is even an outdoor patio and additional play areas constructed out of old shipping containers stacked on top of each other. 

We return to the bar for a second drink and hang out.  Soon things start getting frisky and its clear the party is starting. Its not long before there is just sex happening everywhere. I pick up the protocol rather quickly. As you walk by someone just make solid eye contact and a smile. From there make out a bit. If you want to bottom you can suck them off for a bit. If they haven’t made a motion to stop you can offer to bottom. Some bottoms will just put themselves out there to be fucked by just about anyone by just leaning over a box and waiting. If you’re in the mood to top its pretty much the same procedure except you express a more dominate “tone” with your body language.  There is very little talking during any of this. It’s really cool what we can convey just by body language. 

So at this point I’ll pause and address something important and that’s health and safety. This was something that I worried about going in.  I’ll say that I’m on PREP but I still wasn’t keen on barebacking a bunch of random guys. The good news is that condoms (and lube) are everywhere. And almost everyone I encountered expected their use which was a relief. Only one guy snubbed his nose at me when I took one out. The typical practice was to just stick a bunch of condoms in your sock (remember I said high athletic socks? They hold your condoms and poppers if you want those too). It was a good idea to pre-open the package too with a little tear so that you didn’t have to fumble with it.

So the fun when on for a few hours.  I’d say close to 800 guys were there overall. The smell of sex and sweat filled the air by the time I left. There were condoms and lube all over the floor. I don’t envy the hazmat crew that cleans up after these events. Overall it was a great time.  Everyone I encountered was polite and respectful.  I never felt out of place or forced to do anything I didn’t want. I left exhausted and satisfied. 

Which brings me to Saturday and the Fickstutenmarkt or Horse fair. This event I had heard about from a friend. It is held every few months and we just happened to be in Berlin on the right day. This one was a bit more “exteme” compared to Friday, but in the end equally fun.

At the horse fair you must decide if you want to be a Mare (Bottom) or Stallion (top).  You can’t switch roles once the event starts. The Mares show up early and undress, are hooded with a cotton sack and hands are bound. Mares can pick white hoods (indicated you must use a condom) and red hoods (bareback is ok). They are positioned around the club in slings, on boxes, etc.  Then the Stallions show up.  They are also forced to undress, but can see and walk around freely. The stallions can pick any mare he wants to use and the mare can not object (with a few limitations like if the dick is too big or pierced).  Once the Stallion is done with the mare any other stallion can use it. The stallions while they can see each other can not engage with each other sexually.  If a mare needs a break he can raise his hand and a “stable-hand” employee will guide them to a separate backroom. The mares also leave through a separate door so there is no visual interaction between the mares and stallions.

This event had a similar vide as the first one.  Everyone was really cool and just having a good time. There were far more stallions than mares which surprised me.  Anyway I got to give it to the guys who opt to bottom.  It is clearly physically and emotionally draining to do that but at the same time the turn on from being so submissive is evident. 

I’m sure I left a lot of details out. I’ve probably disgusted a few of you and piqued the interest of others. I wanted to take part in something I normally wouldn’t do and I’m glad I did it all. We shouldn’t be scared of sex and our bodies and this was a great way to gain some confidence in myself, experience something new, and have fun.

Feel free to ask me anything.

118,t3_4oktav,askgaybros,I left my abusive parents and started my own life. I don't know where to go from here. (Warning: Long),"Hi /r/askgaybros,

I don't really know where to start, so I guess I'll just write. I was born in Chile, and am the older of four brothers. When I was very young, for some reason I became the main target of my mom's aggression.

Let me be clear: I wasn't ""spanked"". I was grabbed by the hair, pulled around the house, humiliated, stripped naked, had my things destroyed, and given beatings that could last entire evenings. It was a criminal amount of violence that could be set off by the smallest infractions-- cleaning the window and missing a spot, leaving breadcrumbs on a table and forgetting to clean, breaking a toy, going out at the wrong time, getting a cup of water at night, drinking too much soda and not being ""considerate"" of my parents, asking my mom a question while she was on the phone, slouching, not smiling at the dinner table. *Everything* I did was wrong.

When I wasn't being beaten I was being yelled at. I'm not kidding; it was an all-day thing. If I fought back-- or even if I didn't fight back but she felt like I was implying that I disagreed-- she would overwhelm me with her yelling or start beating me... and she would attack me over everything. All my dreams were impossible to reach, all my interests were worthless and infantile, all my friends weren't good enough for me... and I believed every word of it.

The other side of this abuse is, of course, a very loving mother. One who tended to me when I was sick, and hugged me and kissed me, and took care of me... she made sure that after she broke everything else about me, her love was the one thing I had left-- in other words, that I was trauma-bonded.

Now, you may be asking yourself: where was my dad in all of this? He was there... kinda. He left early in the morning and came back late at night, and he didn't beat me as much but he did. He wasn't really around, and I never bonded with him the same way that I did with my mom.

Things get only more complicated. Like I said: I'm the older of four children. The second oldest child is epileptic, and was at one point having 40 to 50 tonic-clonic generalized seizures a month and he has a lot of brain damage as a result. When he was evaluated as an adult for social security purposes, the professional said he had an IQ of ""less than 30"".

When I was 11 years old, we came to the USA. I did middle school and high school stateside, but in spite of the fact people here are more conscious of child abuse, child services never showed up at my door during that time. I remember one time one of my teachers called my mom a ""helicopter mom"", but overall I was a great student in AP classes, who played in the school band, and I always had a happy demeanor in school. I guess none of my teachers ever saw the red flags.

I always felt like a loser in school, like I was just not measuring up to my peers... I remember being very disappointed that I didn't make it to the top 10% of the class. Looking back now as an adult, I realize that doing as well as I did was incredible given my circumstances.

When college rolled around, I was really depressed and broken down, and I applied to only one college-- a local state college-- and I was accepted into the honors program with a full ride. I knew I was depressed, and for the first time in my life I had access to counseling services, and over the 6 years it took me to graduate I slowly pieced everything together.

A lot of stuff happened in college... I continued to be abused, but starting handling it better and began wrapping my had around my family dynamic. I was actually arrested at one point because I wouldn't mow the lawn-- since I became physically bigger than my mom, I could defend myself pretty easily from her so she decided to get the cops involved. I got frustrated and took the phone from her hand, and she screamed to the cops that I was grabbing her. I was arrested for domestic violence, and spent four days in jail and a month under house arrest. Thankfully charges were dropped.

The thing about abusive parents is that they don't really care about their children being independent, well-adjusted adults... they are about having power and control. I genuinely believe my mom felt threatened by me having a degree, because I would have the opportunity of becoming a professional and no longer being able to control my resources.

Anyways... college was hell, but I knew that my only chance of making it through was sticking it out with my family. I graduated at 24 years old,  and I left as quickly as you can imagine. I spent about a year homeless, and then found a full-time $20 an hour job through one of my friends.

I've been at that position for a little over a year now, and my life was improved incredibly. Unfortunately, I'm still in a lot of debt and have hardly anything to my name, but I have a roof over my head and am independent...

The reason I'm coming here today is because I still don't feel like I have a life. After the events on Sunday at Pulse, I began reading the stories of the victims (each and every one), and started to meditate on my own life. I left that hell of child abuse, but now I feel like I'm in this huge wasteland... I've never had the opportunity to think about these things before, but now that I do I have no one to ask for guidance or support. I'm alone and I have no dreams and no direction, but I know that I have something valuable to offer the world. How do I find it?",24,0.94,80,0,80,,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4oktav/i_left_my_abusive_parents_and_started_my_own_life/
120,t3_5vr5fu,askgaybros,Is my family out of line? (Need 3rd party input),"Hi Bros,

So I've become involved in a situation between my boyfriend and my family that I quite frankly need to have someone else take a look at it because all I hear are the two opposing sides in this issue.

First things first. This is the first boyfriend I've moved in full-time with. I recently got a promotion at work, and while new title and more money, a LOT more work and a LOT more hours. The boyfriend lives far closer to my office than my parents did. I'm 26 and he's 34. I work for a major bank, he has a PhD and teaches at a local university. We're two hard working guys who love each other.

Moving out wasn't exactly a clean break. My mother has this attitude that only bad things can happen to her and everyone else is just complaining and needs to suck it up (meanwhile, she's free to bitch all she wants). It ultimately wound up in a rather heated exchange that I just packed up my shit and left.

Since then, we've made peace, but my mother has always had an issue with me being gay. That being said, she's always been pleasant and polite around my previous boyfriends, and largely kept her opinion to herself of whom I was dating.

Last weekend, my parents went on vacation and my brother, my boyfriend and I were going to ""house sit"", which meant getting stoned, playing FIFA, Netflix marathon, that ol' chestnut.

Around the time I met my boyfriend, my brother had an incident that revealed he had been abusing Xanax and drank heavily on top of taking this stuff, for the past 5 years. Which culminated in my parents basically forcing him off of his prescribed medication of Klonopin (he actually suffers from anxiety attacks). About a month or so before the afformentioned incident, he broke up with his girlfriend - yet made multiple attempts to try and win her back, which ultimately wound up in the girl's father having to file a restraining order against my brother. The girl was not my cup of tea, but I was always pleasant to her face.

Flash forward to the weekend we go to my parents place. My brother allegedly had been 20 days clean of taking any anxiety medication. He was just absolutely straight up rude to my boyfriend. He said that my boyfriend is currently ruining my life, and that no one in family likes him. We left my parents place shortly after that.

Since the revelation about my brother's Xanax problem, I tell my parents any and all incidents that occur (I know it's against the brother code, but his well being is at stake). This incident was no different.

This time though, is that my mother tried justifying my brother's actions! Then she started to dig into my boyfriend about how he drinks too much (he drinks, but nothing out of the norm), and that I could do better. The man has a PhD and graduated magna cum laude from Cornell. That aside, he is the sweetest man ever who has ever given me the time of day, centers me far better than anyone in family ever has, and just loves me. I don't really know how much better I can do than that.

My boyfriend is a sweetheart, but no pushover. He has essentially told me he does not like my brother (and who can blame him?). But now there's a strain on the relationship between him and my parents (he knows what my mom said about him).

My family has been testing my patience as time goes on, and even though I'm finally out, they keep needling their way back into my life, and driving me crazy. Any time I try to tell them I'm just trying to live my life (I.e. not showing up every Sunday for dinner), they think I'm rejecting my identity.

I'm sorry if this seems incoherent, but this whole thing has me emotionally exhausted. I don't want to lose my family, but I'm not letting them break us up.

**Tl;Dr - Brother was abusively rude to my boyfriend, mother defended him**

**UPDATE**: Thank you all for your input. you all basically confirmed what I thought was true. I just wanted a fresh perspective to make sure I wasn't looking at it from a biased perspective.

My brother is officially cut off from me until he apologizes to my boyfriend. If it's never, no skin off my nose.

My mother, has basically given up fighting with me and ended today with ""If you're happy, we're happy"".

The relationship between my family and I has dramatically changed (obviously), but they will not dictate to me who I will be with. I love my boyfriend more than anything in this world, and if my family has a problem with taking a back seat to that, tough.

122,t3_70shoo,askgaybros,I give up. I've had 1 date(ish) in 2 1/2 years and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I need advice. I wrote basically everything about me inside.,"**Not totally sure what to put here so I'll just give you everything and bold the sections so you can find what you think is important. This will be long so just read what you want. What am I not seeing? I feel like I'm somewhat attractive, not amazing but not 1 date in 2 1/2 years bad. How do some of you guys have 2+ hookups a week, I don't get how that's possible.** 

**Live in Atlanta** so you have a location reference point.

**Basic History:** I wasn't out in high school. Came out about 2 1/2 years ago (21 now) while I was teaching English in China for 9 months. It kind of slipped while I was talking to my best friend over Facebook then I just said fuck it and told everyone. Figured if things went poorly I was on the other side of the world, living on my own means, and wouldn't see anyone for another couple months so they would have time to chill. Family wasn't surprised, most had kind of guessed already. Newer friends were pretty surprised but said it made sense after they thought about it for a bit (I'm not really one of those people that you see and go ""oh he's gay"" but also not one of those people where you see them and go ""he's straight"", very middle ground). Came home was fully out and w/e had Grindr and Scruff downloaded when I got home. 

**Gay history:** I've had Scruff and Grindr downloaded for a little more than 2 years and basically nothing has come from either of them. Got asked out(ish) on Grindr once, went because it was my first time being asked out and I was like fuck it. Literally 0 interest there during/ after, so that died.  Wasn't particularly upset, figured something else would happen later and I'd just try again. Downloaded Surge and Tinder maybe a year and a half ago, nothing on either of those also. Went to pride last year, met a couple around my age who were nice and definitely in an open relationship. Ended up hanging out with them, kissed both but couldn't stay because I had work and they had to leave town later that night. I have conversations occasionally on the various apps but they never turn into anything. I message guys I find attractive, respond to others etc... just nothing seems to stick. Never even met another guy through an app after that first date thing. Tried gay bars in Atlanta (Ten, which had good music, and Blake's, which seemed to attract a generally older clientele) except whenever I go it's like I'm basically invisible. 

**Me Now: Super frustrated and really really fucking lonely.** A couple months ago I changed all of my profiles from looking primarily for friends/dates/relationships to anything because I figured if I couldn't meet guys who wanted to date me I could at least meet guys through hook ups or whatever. Except still nothing. Cute/ hot guys that I was talking to just disappear. Guys I message don't really respond. I was thinking about it last night and I legitimately just sat down and actually fucking cried. Which is kind of pathetic but there you have it. It just feels so hopeless. You would think something like the law of large numbers might apply but apparently they don't. Below is my ""everything about me"" if there's something in it that you think might be turning people off, please tell me.  

**Everything about me:** 

**Pictures:**[Link](https://imgur.com/a/3cPKR)

**Me by numbers:** 21, 6'1"", 160 lbs. I realize twinks aren't everyone's cup of tea and I'm fine with that but for fuck's sake.

**Personality:** I'm generally a pretty quiet guy in any context that I'm not totally comfortable in (I have anti-anxiety meds that allow me to actually say hi to new people). Bookish/ academic. I genuinely enjoy learning/ school. I'm the kid that's gotten up every day legitimately excited to go to school (it's kind of sad, I know). Competitive. Very driven to succeed (almost straight A's in college so far--fuck calculus). I can be very type A. 

**Interests:** School (yes I actually love school. I want to be a professor/ researcher after I graduate/ my PhD), Languages (working on Mandarin, Spanish, and Italian), Linguistics (my major), biking, kayaking (one of my favorite things to do on a nice day), reading, computers (built my own last July), computer games, sports cars (I think they're actually gorgeous creations lol). I'll watch most sports socially and I'd play soccer if I had regulars to play with. My family (because they are great people that I enjoy hanging out with).

**Guys I'd be into:** Race doesn't matter. Anyone 5'8"" + is fine (feel like it would be awkward to bottom for a guy more than 5-6 inches shorter than me but idk). Anything from skinny-avg-fit is fine and femininity doesn't really bother me as long as they don't full on dress like a woman. I don't feel like that's particularly picky but I don't know. 

**Other:** work part time also (16-24 a week). 

**tl;dr: Tried everything from apps to bars in the past 2 1/2 years and I haven't made a single gay friend, gone on a date, or hooked up for anyone and I legitimately don't know what to do anymore. Actually cried myself to sleep last night because I can't drown my loneliness out by being busy like I have been up to this point. Sorry that there's so much to read. Figured having it all out there might help.**

123,t3_54ur0u,askgaybros,I feel like I dodged a very dangerous bullet. What do you bros think? Need some serious advice here.,"Apologies for the wall of text. Using a throwaway because of reasons that might become clear soon..

In the past few days, a guy messaged me on Grindr; I thought he was good looking, with a fit body to boot. I replied and we started a conversation. To give you more context without revealing his identity, he was also settled, extremely well-educated and seemed to have the rare elusive combination of brains and brawn.

He identifies as a total, dominant top. I'm a versatile guy but have bottomed more before, so I thought why the hell not? I'm open minded and in the prime of my life and we discussed how it would play out with him on top and also maybe involving another dominant top.

However, some red flags started to emerge. He was fetishizing my race (he's white, I'm not), stuff like how *'all you &lt;insert non-white race here&gt; bitches are bottoms'*. Secondly, he expressed an intention to bareback eventually. The latter was maybe too soon and perhaps not a red flag to many here; but overall since I was quite blinded by my wanting to hook up with him, I overlooked these red flags.

Then this happened..

I was asking to meet him over the weekend and we were on the cusp of discussing a time when the following conversation happened (his IMs in bold, mine in italics) - 

**Want to be raped pretty much?**

*Wtf no!*

*I realize that we're far from being on the same page*

**Calm yourself**

**As I said I find you hot you're my type of bottom and if you want to explore and learn how to have some great fun I'm your guy but I'm not looking to stare into your eyes over a cup of coffee**

*I don't even mean it that way. I'm not looking for something serious. But you're way off the mark if you think I have a fantasy to get raped*

**Ha calm yourself as I said**

*I think you're missing a point if you think I'm flipping my shit for no reason*

**Dude you're a bottom you're going to get raped plain and simple don't get all left wing terminology shit with me**

**And I'm not interested anyway**

I blocked him faster than Trump could lie again.

I would like to ask you bros if there is anything I missed or any place I could have handled this better or predicted it going the way it did a lot earlier. *What do tops here think?* Is this how the world works now? Am I being a prude for not humoring him?

I'm quite perplexed as to how someone this well-educated can be this deranged and psychopathic. I can't help but feel that this is the sort of mentality that gives us vermin like Brock Turner.

**tl;dr:** A guy went total psycho on me on Grindr. Please stay safe bros, they come in all forms.

130,t3_4wi7kt,askgaybros,My homophobic grandma is in hospital and may die and I'm not sure I should visit her.,"Background

In 2010, I was at my ‘grandma’s’ house watching 3ABN (a religious broadcasting network), and the subject of gay marriage came up. I had come out to her a year earlier to which her response was ‘I don’t believe you’re gay as you don’t act like those stereotypical gay people’. Since the topic was sort of broached, and because I didn’t want her to hate me or deny my existence I asked her how she felt about me being gay. She asked me if I knew what ‘those homosexual people do?’ I answered yes; she told me it was ‘sick’, she also thought it was sick that my mother was alright with me being gay. Then she told me ‘If you do that thing that those homosexuals do, you can’t eat from my plate nor drink from cup.’ To which I replied ‘I guess that means that I’m not your grandson anymore.’ But I’m not sure that she heard because she made no comment. Not wanting to leave with that being our last words, I tried to convince her that me being gay wasn’t a negative thing, whilst I don’t remember what I said, I do remember her telling me to ‘stop with all this business of being a puff and get a girlfriend.’ I left distraught, as my world started to slowly crumble around me. 

I told my mother what had happened, she told ‘grandma’ off and didn’t speak to her for a week. After this week had passed my mother informed me that ‘grandma’ wanted to apologise. I knew the moment she told me that it was a bad idea to go and that ‘grandma’ wasn’t really going to apologise. Nevertheless, my mother looked extremely earnest, so I went. When I got to ‘grandma’s’ house, she informed me that ‘I didn’t mean to upset you; I only said it because they (3ABN) were saying it on the TV.’ I was disgusted with this ‘apology’, for one she didn’t actually apologise, further more this seventy nine year old woman was refusing to take responsibility for what she said and for her beliefs and opinions which I knew very much that she felt were right.  When I told my mother whilst she didn’t say it, I could see on her face that she knew it wasn’t a real apology. She informed me ‘that’s just how she is; you’re just going to have to accept the apology.’  I believe I was disowned, my mother disagrees. But if she didn’t disown me what did she do? 

I didn’t see her again until Christmas Eve of the same year. I opened the door to her and my uncle, I greeted them both but, I didn’t call her ‘grandma’, because to me she wasn’t. She however felt differently asking me why I didn’t call her grandma in front of my mother, uncle and cousin. I couldn’t answer, I wanted to scream ‘because you’re not my grandma’ but I knew I couldn’t. Instead I looked to my uncle, who I recently told he was like a father to me, and my cousin, who I shared a close bond with, for help, but they looked away. My mother, like hers, just looked at me expectantly.
In the end I was forced to apologise.

I tried to get over it, I tried to move past it but it’s really difficult to do that when the family members you try to talk to about it keep cutting off every one of your sentences to tell you what a wonderful person their mother is and how it would be a loss for you not to have her in your life. Which is understandable but it didn’t help because I was dying inside.

I’ve suffered from dysthymia (low level depression) since 2007, so whilst I was depressed I was still functional, I wrote poetry, fan fiction and worked on my novel, I enjoyed both listening to and playing music, I loved reading, I ate at regular times etc. But once ‘grandma’ said what she said my world changed, I developed major depression which combined with dysthymia creates double depression. Thus food began to taste like ash, music became white noise, I used to write, I used to be good at it- brilliant- in fact, but now the words just don’t come, just trying to write a sentence is a herculean task, what once seemed achievable dreams now to seem to be fantasies. I can no longer read a book, the words do not register. I have no energy, I have no ambition, the most beautiful sight does not move me, the thought of having to do any tasks drains me of energy and I feel every cell in my body scream when I attempt to carry out a task, I feel empty inside, like it is a constant grey haze in my mind, in my soul and there is nothing I can do to alleviate it. I feel comatose. For the past six years my first thought in the morning and my last thought at night is: I want to die, when I believed in God I asked him to kill me multiple times, there are only two constant wants in my life now: I want to sleep and I want to die. 

In June 2011, having watched Kung Fu Panda 2 I decided to research the Buddhist philosophy of inner peace. I thought about what would give me inner peace and came to the conclusion that ‘grandma’ couldn’t be part of my life anymore because she’d just continue to hurt me. But I didn’t want to because I knew it would hurt her and I didn’t want to hurt her, I didn’t want to cause the slightest bit of/same pain she caused me; I couldn’t put her through that. But I also couldn’t live with her in my life anymore, her touch made my skin crawl, it hurts to look at her, being in her presence made me want to run, admitting that I love her, forcing myself to call her ‘grandma’ destroys a piece of my soul and makes me feel like I’m betraying myself, destroying myself in the process. I don’t want to feel this way, I never thought I would feel this way about my ‘grandma’ but she’s not my grandma, my grandma is dead she died the same day she destroyed me. 
As I resigned myself to go, I promised myself that if she apologised when I told her how much pain she had caused me, I would forgive her, apologise for telling her she couldn’t be in my life anymore and move on.
But just like I knew she wasn’t going to apologise a year earlier, I knew she wouldn’t apologise now. In fact she got angry, listing some of the things she had done for me throughout my life before calling me ungrateful, which I knew she would do but I wanted to give her the benefit of doubt. 
Once my mother learned of what I did she informed me that she didn’t care what her mother said and that I should never make her mother feel unwelcome in her house.

It’s been five years since then and this woman who destroyed me, whose touch repulses me, whose
presence sickens me, this woman who makes me want to die and pray to God for death, who I am
forced to call ‘grandma’ is still in my life.

I still want her out of my life for the pain is unbearable, having to talk to her, having to pretend to like
her, having to be civil to her is killing me.  But I fear that it has been too long for it to be justifiable to disown her and also, like five years ago, I don’t want to hurt her. I also fear that by removing her from my life that would mean having to lose the only family I have and there are three members who are the only reason I have been able to bear this situation.


Today 


‘Grandma’ is in hospital; she lost a lot of blood and could have nearly died. I’m scared that she may die, I don’t want her to die, I love her but when I say that it’s as if I’m back in her house having my soul ripped out all over again. In fact this is what it’s like every time I see her, every time I am forced to call her ‘grandma’, every time I am forced to speak to her, touch her, every time I think of her I find myself back in that house dying all over again. So, I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to go visit her but she may die and I cannot ascertain whether I would regret not visiting her or be okay with it. Part of me wants to go but that is more to ensure that I wouldn’t regret going and have to live with the guilt for the rest of my life. 

Thus, I have a few questions. Was I disowned? Am I as bad as or worse than my ‘grandma’ for wanting her out of my life? Am I a terrible person for not wanting to go especially since there is a possibility that she may die? What would you do if you were in my position? If she does survive should I tell her (and possibly my mother/uncle/cousin) how I feel and risk losing my family?

132,t3_4euye9,askgaybros,"Made stupid, rash decisions and now I hate myself.","I dated my ex for 11 months. Before I tell you this, I want to make it known that I was not dis-satisfied with our sex life, the best sex I've ever had was with him. Even though I get the best pleasure of my life from the physical aspect of sex with him, the emotional and mental aspect was what threw me over the wall. But after 11 months of only have sex with one guy, and trying literally everything we could think of, I wanted to try something different. 


I came to him, and asked that we give each other 1 time passes. I didn't really want to open the relationship, I just wanted to get this obsession with fucking someone else over, and if I was going to fuck someone else it was only fair that I give him the same opportunity. 


Ooh how that backfired on me. It lead to an argument which ended with him saying if he wanted to have sex with someone else he would just breakup with me and he 'expected me to give him the same courtesy'. I honestly had no idea it was going to be that much of a hot-button issue. 


I decided to just let the whole idea die there, and thats what I was going to do. But two days later he came to me and said he's been going crazy thinking that instead of respecting his answer (which was no) I either already had, or was going to, cheat on him. He said that he couldn't live like that, the trust in the relationship for him was gone, and that he wanted to end it. 


I didn't see that coming at all, and it actually made me cry, because even though our relationship was only 11 months, I honestly felt like this was the guy I was going to marry, I loved him so much it was absolutely ridiculous, and he loved me just as much. 


So, a month went by and I had moved out of our apartment. I got a text from his supposed 'best friend'. I could *tell* he was leading me on. Not to put a value on the life of a human being, but my ex is probably a 9 and this guy is a 4, but at this point it really didn't matter to me. I decided that I was going to get back at my ex (that was the hurt-heart furious me thinking) by sleeping with his best friend.


Me and his best friend had sex maybe 9 times. Each time was horrible. The guy is completely selfish in bed, a genuinely miserable human being that makes me disgusted in our species. I didn't even finish half the time, I faked it and then quickly threw away the condom so he wouldn't notice. The last time we did have sex it was tearing me apart because I knew that I wasn't really getting back at my ex, I was only destroying any chance that he would ever want to even look at me again. After we finished that time, he turned to me and asked ""So, where do you see this going?"" and I confessed that I was really using him to get back at my ex, and I couldn't do it anymore because I felt like shit, and I apologize to him for using him like an object when he's really a human being who deserves happiness just like everyone else. 


Boy was he mad. He got dressed and he was cursing me out the entire time, then he walked out of my apartment. I realize he has a right to be mad, but honestly, he came to my apartment and tried to get me drunk before sex because he thought if I was sober I would back out, so he's no angel either. 


Anyway, three days later I got a call from my boyfriend who was on the other end crying. Sadly, I missed his call, but his voicemail was filled with things like ""I acted to quickly. I miss you. I miss sleeping with you, please come home and we can talk about how we can patch things up. Please forgive me."" and all of that. I saw that voicemail roughly 3 hours after he left it. 


When I called him back, the tone on the line was completely different. He said he had called his best friend because he needed someone to talk to, and when he confessed that he had called me and asked me to get back together, his best friend told him all about the sex we had, and the best friend twisted to story to where I was having sex with him to 'get over' my boyfriend. He twisted the story to where I was the one who was coming onto him, when in reality, he was coming onto me **hard** and I have the text messages to prove it. A face saving image I guess, even though he honestly looks like a frog, and no amount of plastic surgery in the world will ever be able to fix that so he might as well save his money and buy a boat or something. 


Needless to say, my ex went completely off, called me a douche told me to rot in hell and then hung up on me. Now he's pissed at me and his best friend, and his best friend is pissed at me also. He's blocked my number (texts no longer say delivered) and I honestly feel like a piece of shit. Oh, and I also blocked his best friend because he kept texting me about meeting up again. Yes, after all this transpired, his best friend wanted to meet up for sex. Luckily, that isn't my ex's only close friend, and I hope he chooses not to deal with that ~~whore~~ guy anymore. 


I feel horrible for what I did, I miss my ex more than anything in this entire world and I want us to get back together, but I don't know if thats plausible. Part of me is screaming at me to just let him be, but I *know* for a **fact** that I can make him happier than any other human being on this planet, and he can make me happier than anything in the entire universe. 


Sadly, leaving him alone is not an option for me. I realize I made a mistake, a horrible mistake, but I need my boyfriend back in my life. I honestly don't think its worth continuing without him. This Earth and the people on it are all going to shit, and he was the only person who brought light into my life, with his optimistic 'cup half-full' point of view. How do I apologize to him in a way that lets him know I'm being sincere, and that I not only miss him, but genuinely need him? Sleeping with his best friend was a malicious, foolish, and short sighted thing to do, and I regret it more than any other decisions in my entire life. If I could re-do history and remove that part, I would. I was so close to getting back with the only man I've ever had such deep feelings for, and then a foolish decision made out of haste and hurt on my part basically wrecked everything again.

133,t3_22whbz,askgaybros,Dis-Illusioned,"Some of you might recognize my mountainously verbose postings of a rather pessimistic ramblings.  I know I'm a downvote bullseye or a wet blanket or a swig of piss to go with your cornflakes but I'm feeling at least more grounded lately and I wanted to share and see what you, humble reader, might think about where I stand (even though this is an advice column for gay guys, go figure some are nasty?).

Anyways it all started when I asked a friend who was saying that they needed to get church going back in their life like they missed it like a cup of coffee.  I tried at first to play devils advocate and illuminate my simpler friend to what exactly make up the tenements of non-religious thinking (aka logic &amp; reason).  And he was receptive, so I introduced actual counter-arguments against the very notion that there would ever even be a ""god"" figure, judging us in the clouds and damning our brothers and sisters for all eternity because the all powerful ego-maniac was denied enough praise.  At which point he turned off his obviously logical brain, and deferred to pretending like he was listening only to be phased out, a thousand miles away where my thoughts couldnt touch his precious beliefs.

And I thought how fragile life was, how insignificant we all are, how cruel it is the twist of fate that I might be regarded as less than a human for simply being me.  And then he said an off comment to a friend about how I must know what its like being a chick because being gay is basically like being a girl, and essentially attempted to emasculate me, strong arm me, and leverage his masculinity against mine.  I think in any civilized setting his behavior is wildly intolerable but it begs the question:  are religious people normally this clueless, this bone-headed and abrasive, this haphazard cacophony of pointlessly circular rationale that desperately seeks to compartmentalize complex interactions so as to be consumed as a commodity, churning quantum mechanics into soda pop.  

Is being religious correlated with being moronic?  In these days, I cannot even keep lying to myself that there is a point to saving the ""religious"" aspect of humanity.  It has done no good for thousands of years and creates only discord and strife and hatred.  It sure as hell almost killed me a few times, sometimes by my own hand, for the sake of thoughts and feelings.  How can fairy tales and bedtime superstition keep people so blind and helpless and callous to the obvious and glaring needs, rights, and empathetic moral centers of their fellow man?  Are humans this stupid?

Why do we coddle the masses into thinking that there should be a debate on whether or not a whole subcategory of people deserve rights?  Is it ok to subjugate a relatively big piece of our world, just because it hurts someones feelings that they dont get to keep lying to themselves any more?  When can we tear back this curtain of bullshit and start trusting each other more without all the cockamamie horsecrap flying around?

In short, religion is pathetic and its a shame we still have to begrudgingly drag ourselves out of this thought-corrupting slump.  If we cant turn this shit around, get rid of these ridiculous puppet states, learn how to speak one language, and build space stations for galactic colonization, then we are worthless and id like to extend the cosmic hand to wipe away this snotty sneeze of arrogant assholes.  

If you are religious and you read this, I hope you feel sorry for yourself, because you are a part of the problem until you can learn that even if there is a collective unconscious, it wants nothing to do with our daily lives and cares nothing for who we are.  It just is, as we just are, and we have to learn to live for ourselves now, quit nancing around in the garden of fucking eden, put on some god damned clothes, and wipe those un-used eyes so as to read a few good mathematics textbooks.
